# David Rodenas Portfolio Website (v2025)

## Overview
This is a retro terminal-style developer portfolio website for David Rodenas. It's built with Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. The site simulates a command-line interface where visitors can navigate using familiar commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `cat` to explore content stored as markdown files.

## Technical Stack
- Next.js 15.2
- React 19
- TypeScript
- TailwindCSS 4
- IBM Plex Mono font (for terminal aesthetics)

## Core Implementation Patterns

### Dependency Injection System
- Located in `src/utils/injector/`
- Custom implementation of dependency injection for React components
- Key classes:
  - `Injector`: Core container managing dependencies
  - `AbstractSubject`: Base class for observable subjects
  - `Subject`: Generic implementation of state containers with subscribers
- Custom hooks:
  - `useInject`: Retrieves dependencies from context
  - `useInjection`: Sets up dependencies in context

### Terminal Simulation
- `src/features/terminal/TerminalScreen.ts`: 
  - Handles display of command outputs as ReactNodes
  - Manages terminal state including scrollback buffer

### Shell Implementation
- Located in `src/features/shell/`
- Components:
  - `Shell.tsx`: Main shell component with command input and processing
  - `ShellCommandExecutor.ts`: Executes commands using the command dictionary
  - `CommandHistory.ts`: Manages history of executed commands
  - `CurrentPath.ts`: Tracks and manipulates the current working directory

### Command System
- Plugin-based architecture where commands are registered and discovered through the `ShellCommandDictionary`
- Each command implements the `Command` interface from `Command.ts`
- Available commands:
  - `ls`: List directory contents
  - `cd`: Change directory
  - `cat`: Display file contents
  - `clear`: Clear terminal screen
- Command components include interactive elements like `LinkCat` and `LinkCd` that execute commands when clicked

### Prompt System
- Located in `src/components/Prompt/`
- Features:
  - `Prompt.tsx`: Input component for the terminal
  - `usePromptCompletion.ts`: Hook for tab completion functionality
  - `usePromptHistory.ts`: Hook for navigating command history

### Content Management
- Content stored as Markdown files in `public/content/`
- Utilities in `src/utils/content/`:
  - `directories.ts`: Functions for navigating the virtual directory structure
  - `files.ts`: Functions for accessing and reading file content
- Content index generated by script in `scripts/generate-content-index.js`

## Application Flow
1. Next.js page loads the main Shell component
2. Shell initializes terminal and command system via dependency injection
3. Initial command (usually `cat ~/README.md`) is executed automatically
4. User interacts by typing commands or clicking interactive elements
5. Command output is rendered to the terminal screen

## Key Architectural Decisions
1. **Virtual File System**: Content is organized as a virtual file system, making navigation intuitive
2. **Reactive State Management**: Custom subjects provide reactive state without external libraries
3. **Component Isolation**: Command implementations are isolated, making the system extensible
4. **Interactive UI Elements**: Links in output can trigger commands, enhancing UX
5. **SSG-Ready**: Structure supports Static Site Generation for optimal performance

## Content Structure
- `public/content/`: All site content
  - `README.md`: Initial welcome message
  - `whoami.md`: Personal information
  - `contact-links.md`: Contact information
  - `projects/`: Portfolio projects
    - Individual project markdown files

This project elegantly combines modern web technologies with a nostalgic terminal interface to create a unique developer portfolio experience.
