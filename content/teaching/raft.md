# Raft, and a recipe for concurrency

In the autumn of 2013 the distributed systems laboratory at the UOC set its
students a consensus algorithm to implement: Raft, which was then a draft
going round, a year away from being presented. I worked on that laboratory,
and [my implementation is public](https://github.com/drpicox/uoc-raft-2013p):
one Java class over the course's skeleton, dated October 2013.

Raft was designed to be understandable, and it is. The hard part of the
assignment is somewhere else. A server is doing four things at once —
timing out, asking for votes, answering other servers' requests, replicating
its log — every one of them reads and writes the same few fields, and between
any two lines the network may hand it a message that makes it a different
kind of server. That is a lot to ask of someone writing their first
concurrent program.

## The recipe

So the implementation follows a recipe simple enough to be followed by
someone who cannot yet reason about interleavings, and still concurrent:

```flow
lock1[1 · inside the guard\ncheck who you are\ncopy what you need] --> out[2 · outside the guard\ncompute, wait, talk\nto the network]
out --> lock2[3 · inside the guard again\ncheck nothing changed\nonly then write]
lock2 -->|something changed| drop[give up quietly\nthe next timeout\nwill try again]
```

1. **One guard for all the state.** Not a lock per field: one. Take it,
   check that you are still what you think you are — *only leaders send
   heartbeats* — and copy everything you are about to need into local
   variables that nothing else can touch.
2. **Let go before doing anything slow.** Never hold the guard across the
   network. The remote call runs with the copies, on another thread, for as
   long as it takes, and the server goes on answering everyone else.
3. **Take the guard again, and trust nothing.** The answer arrives in a world
   that has moved. Am I still the leader? Is it still the same term? Is this
   follower's index still where I left it? If any answer is no, drop the
   result and return. There is nothing to undo, because nothing was written.

Here it is in the leader's heartbeat, shortened but in the code's own words
and with its own comments:

```java
synchronized (GUARD) {
    // only leaders perform heartbeats
    if (state != RaftState.LEADER) return;

    // gather common info (from iteration to iteration may become rotten)
    term = persistentState.getCurrentTerm();
    prevLogIndex = nextIndexes.get(otherServer) - 1;
    prevLogTerm = persistentState.getTerm(prevLogIndex);
    entries = prevLogIndex > -1 ? persistentState.getLogEntries(prevLogIndex+1) : new ArrayList<LogEntry>();
    commitIndex = this.commitIndex;
}

// send the message (and listen the answer) in concurrent
executorQueue.execute(new Runnable() {
    public void run() {
        AppendEntriesResponse response = RMIsd.getInstance()
            .appendEntries(otherServer, term, leaderId, prevLogIndex, prevLogTerm, entries, commitIndex);

        // execute inside the guard, any sent data could be changed and must be reevaluated
        synchronized (GUARD) {
            // still leader?
            if (state != RaftState.LEADER) return;
            // term changed?
            if (term != persistentState.getCurrentTerm()) return;
            // prevLogIndex changed?
            if (nextIndexes.get(otherServer) - 1 != prevLogIndex) return;

            // … only now is anything written
        }
    }
});
```

That is the whole of it. The two comments that matter are the code's own: *gather
common info (from iteration to iteration may become rotten)* going in, and
*execute inside the guard, any sent data could be changed and must be
reevaluated* coming back.

## Why it works

It removes the two things a beginner gets wrong. There is one lock, so there
is no order of locks to get wrong and no deadlock. And no lock is held while
waiting, so nothing stalls behind a slow server. What is left is the one real
difficulty, stale data, and the recipe turns it from something to reason
about into something to check: a list of `if`s at the top of step three.

It costs something. Work is sometimes thrown away, and it leans on Raft
being built the same way — terms and indices are exactly the version numbers
step three needs. But that is not a coincidence to apologise for. Optimistic
concurrency, compare-and-swap, a database's `UPDATE … WHERE version = ?`:
read, work outside, write only if nothing moved. It is the pattern most
concurrent code that works turns out to have.

Making parallel machines usable by people who are not parallel programmers
was [what my PhD was about](/research/). This was the same problem, with
students in place of scientists.
