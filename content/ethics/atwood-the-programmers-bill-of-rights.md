# The Programmer's Bill of Rights

Marko Zivanovic publishes at [codinghorror.com](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-programmers-bill-of-rights/)
the following bill of rights for programmers:

> - **Every programmer shall have two monitors**
>
> With the crashing prices of LCDs and the ubiquity of dual-output video cards,
> you'd be crazy to limit your developers to a single screen. The productivity
> benefits of doubling your desktop are well documented by now. If you want to
> maximize developer productivity, make sure each developer has two monitors. Or
> three.
>
> - **Every programmer shall have a fast PC**
>
> Developers are required to run a lot of software to get their jobs done:
> development environments, database engines, web servers, virtual machines, and
> so forth. Running all this software requires a fast PC with lots of memory.
> The faster a developer's PC is, the faster they can cycle through debug and
> compile cycles. You'd be foolish to pay the extortionist prices for the
> extreme top of the current performance heap – but always make sure you're
> buying near the top end. Outfit your developers with fast PCs that have lots
> of memory. Time spent staring at a progress bar is wasted time.
>
> - **Every programmer shall have their choice of mouse and keyboard**
>
> In college, I ran a painting business. Every painter I hired had to buy their
> own brushes. This was one of the first things I learned. Throwing a standard
> brush at new painters didn't work. The "company" brushes were quickly
> neglected and degenerated into a state of disrepair. But painters who bought
> their own brushes took care of them. Painters who bought their own brushes
> learned to appreciate the difference between the professional \$20 brush they
> owned and cheap disposable dollar store brushes. Having their own brush
> engendered a sense of enduring responsibility and craftsmanship. Programmers
> should have the same relationship with their mouse and keyboard – they are the
> essential, workaday tools we use to practice our craft and should be treated
> as such.
>
> - **Every programmer shall have a comfortable chair**
>
> Let's face it. We make our livings largely by sitting on our butts for 8 hours
> a day. Why not spend that 8 hours in a comfortable, well-designed chair? Give
> developers chairs that make sitting for 8 hours not just tolerable, but
> enjoyable. Sure, you hire developers primarily for their giant brains, but
> don't forget your developers' other assets.
>
> - **Every programmer shall have a fast internet connection**
>
> Good programmers never write what they can steal. And the internet is the best
> conduit for stolen material ever invented. I'm all for books, but it's hard to
> imagine getting any work done without fast, responsive internet searches at my
> fingertips.
>
> - **Every programmer shall have quiet working conditions**
>
> Programming requires focused mental concentration. Programmers cannot work
> effectively in an interrupt-driven environment. Make sure your working
> environment protects your programmers' flow state, otherwise they'll waste
> most of their time bouncing back and forth between distractions.
>
> The few basic rights we're asking for are easy. They aren't extravagant
> demands. They're fundamental to the quality of work life for a software
> developer. If the company you work for isn't getting it right, making it right
> is neither expensive nor difficult. Demand your rights as a programmer! And
> remember: you can either change your company, or you can change your company.
