# Ethics in the Classroom

As a teacher, I incorporate ethics into my software engineering courses to help students understand the responsibility they have as future developers.

## Key Principles Taught

I teach students that we developers have an enormous responsibility because our code runs on billions of devices worldwide. With this power comes responsibility in three key areas:

1. **Protecting society**: Faulty software can have catastrophic consequences, as seen in cases like the Boeing 737 Max 8 crashes or the Volkswagen emissions scandal.

2. **Protecting clients**: Poor quality code and technical debt can destroy companies, as in the BancSabadell/TSB case, where rushed development led to massive failures.

3. **Protecting colleagues**: Creating technical debt harms other developers who inherit your code, potentially damaging their careers and professional growth.

## Teaching Methods

In my classroom, I emphasize these ethical principles through:

- Case studies of software failures with real-world impacts
- Hands-on practice with Test-Driven Development
- Discussion of professional oaths and manifestos
- Group exercises on ethical decision-making
- Code review practices that emphasize maintainability and clarity

## Further Resources

For students and professionals interested in software ethics, I recommend these resources:

- [Bill of Rights](/ethics/bill-of-rights)
- [TDD Rules](/ethics/tdd-rules)
- [Agile Manifesto](/ethics/agile-manifesto)
- [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](/ethics/software-craftsmanship-manifesto)
