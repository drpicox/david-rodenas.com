# Zivanovic's Programmer's Oath

Marko Zivanovic proposes in his blog post "[Programmer's Oath](https://www.markozivkovic.com/blog/programmers-oath)" a more concrete oath with eight promises to make:

1. I will thoroughly analyze the problem before coding a solution.
2. I will write the simplest code that solves the problem.
3. I will write clear code that others can easily understand and modify.
4. I will write tests to thoroughly validate the code I create.
5. I will improve existing code whenever I see room for improvement.
6. I will eagerly learn from feedback on my code.
7. I will constantly improve my programming knowledge and skills.
8. I will support the growth of the less experienced programmers around me.
