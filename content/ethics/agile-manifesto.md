# Ethics of the Agile Manifesto

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is the first attempt in the
industry to create a conduct code between the professional and its customer. It
seeks to create confidence between professionals and customers. It states four
simple statements:

- **Individuals and interactions**: over processes and tools
- **Working software**: over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration**: over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change**: over following a plan

To clarify those statements it presents the
[twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

It helps to protect our client and our fellow colleages.
