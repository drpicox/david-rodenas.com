# The program that finished before the professor left

*Tècniques i Mètodes d'Intel·ligència Artificial*, FIB, June 1999. The lab
was a parser: a field guide to birds, one card per species written in
ordinary Spanish sentences, to be read by a Prolog program and turned into
facts a program could ask questions of.

```
Nombre: Abubilla, Upupa epops.

Identificación: Plumaje pardo-rosado; en vuelo alas y cola blancas y
negras, muy anchas; moño rosado, con puntas negras y largo pico…
```

becomes

```prolog
nombre(vulgar([abubilla]), cientifico([upupa, epops]))
identificacion([plumaje([plumaje, pardo-rosado]), vuelo([vuelo]),
                alas([alas]), cola([cola, blancas, y, negras, muy, anchas]), …])
```

The day it was due, the professor came round with a floppy of test cards,
handed it over, and started to walk away, because with everyone else's
program the test took ten or twenty minutes to run. We put the disk in,
looked at what was on it, ran the program, and called after him before he
had reached the door. It was done.

## What the code says happened

I remembered the reason as *an LL grammar*, and after twenty-seven years I
was not sure the memory was right. The ten versions are still on a floppy — `T1.PL` to `TF.PL`, the eighth
to the fourteenth of June — and a classmate's beside them, so it can be
checked. Both are the same size and both are DCGs, Prolog's grammar rules.
The difference is the shape of the rules.

The other program looks for **keys inside a sentence**: it walks the words,
and at each one asks whether it is a key, or a superkey with keys inside it,
or a separator, and on failure it backs up and tries another reading —

```prolog
s_SuperClave(F)        --> s_LClaves(F, [], Ffin, _), s_SuperClave(Ffin).
s_SuperClave([F|Ffin]) --> t_SuperClave(_, F, Fdins), s_VariasClaves(Fdins, []), s_SuperClave(Ffin).
s_SuperClave(F)        --> s_LPalabras(Lp, Lf), s_SuperClave_F1(F, Lp, Lf).
```

Three alternatives for the same head, none of which can be told apart
without reading ahead, so Prolog tries them in turn and, deep inside a long
card, tries them again and again. That is what a twenty-minute run is.

Mine decides at the **first word**:

```prolog
s_UnaFicha(F) --> s_Identificacion(F).
s_UnaFicha(F) --> s_Nidificacion(F).
s_UnaFicha(F) --> s_Alimentacion(F).
s_UnaFicha(F) --> s_Habitat(F).
s_UnaFicha(F) --> s_Nombre(F).

s_Nombre(nombre(vulgar(Lv), cientifico(Lc)))
    --> t_Nombre, t_DosPuntos, s_NomPalabras(Lv), s_NomSeparador, s_NomPalabras(Lc), s_Punto_PotserNula.
```

Every alternative of `s_UnaFicha` begins with a terminal that no other
begins with — `Nombre`, `Identificación`, `Alimentación` — so the first
token picks the rule and nothing is ever tried twice. Inside each rule the
same holds: lists are read by "one more, or none" pairs that never need to
look back, and `analisis` cuts, with `!`, at the first parse. The grammar is
LL(1) by construction — which is what I had set out to write, having just
learnt in the compilers course what it bought — and the facts the cards had
to become were rewritten until a grammar of that kind could produce them,
which is the other half of the trick.

It is the same lesson as the one the thesis taught later about
[loops](/research/loops-into-zones/): the algorithm was not made faster. It
was rewritten so that the machine underneath — here, Prolog's search — had
nothing to search.
