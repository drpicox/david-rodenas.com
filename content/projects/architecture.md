# How this site is built

The code of this site is written by an AI — Claude, in Claude Code — from
what I ask of it. I say what the site is and how it should be made; it
writes the program, and the tests.

The picture is that program. Every ball is a file, every box a folder of the
frame or a feature, and every arrow a box that needs another. It is read from
the source by the TypeScript compiler, at every commit that changed it. Play
it and watch it grow; tangle it to see the same files with nobody saying
where anything goes, and untangle it again. Put the tests in, and every file
with something in it to run that no test imports directly is drawn as a
ring.

The picture can be looked through lenses. A ball can be as big as the files
that need it — the hotspots, the files a change reaches first — or as the
files it needs; as all the files a change to it could reach, near or far; as
much as it stands between the others; as the commits that have changed it so
far, which grows as the history plays and stops where a file settles; or as
its lines. It can be coloured by how lately it changed, by how much the
changes below it made it likely to change, or by how stable its box is, with
the arrows that go against stability in red. Threads can be drawn between the
files that changed together, dashed where no arrow joins them; tangled, they
pull the files together too. Every file a commit changes rings as it comes.

Point at a file, and what it is asked to show comes out: its own arrows, in
blue what it needs and in orange what needs it, one arrow out or as far as
they go, the blast radius of a change in both directions; the group the
arrows gather it into; or the files that changed with it. Click a file, a box
or a commit, and it opens on [GitHub](https://github.com/drpicox/david-rodenas.com)
as it stood then.

::architecture

How often each file changes, how far a change travels, and which files
change together with no arrow between them is the other half of this
picture: [how this site changes](/projects/changes/).

## What the tangle shows

Tangled, with no boxes, the files arrange themselves by the arrows alone,
and structures appear: knots of files that need one another, and files that
everything seems to pass through. Both can be counted, and the figures here
follow the picture's history as it plays.

**The groups the arrows make.** The Louvain method (Blondel and others,
2008) finds the groups a graph makes without being told any: it moves each
file into the group that keeps the most arrows inside it, then treats each
group as one file and starts again, until nothing moves. How much a grouping
keeps inside itself, beyond what arrows drawn at random would, is its
modularity (Newman and Girvan, 2004), and it can be worked out for the boxes
too.

::tangle-groups

Many features make a group of their own: islands, as the rules want. Where
the arrows gather several boxes into one group, some features lean on a
part of the frame more than on anything else, and it goes with them. Set
pointing to show its group, and the picture draws any file's.

**The bridges.** Some files stand between the others: most of the shortest
ways from one file to another pass through them, the arrows read either
way. Set the size to bridges, and the picture shows how much each does.

::tangle-bridges

When this was written, on 28 September 2026, the first three were the
contract every feature fulfils, the one way to make an element on the page,
and the one way to make text safe to print: the files a change would be felt
through on most roads across the source.

**How far a change could reach.** Every arrow is a road a change could take
back to what needs it. The share of the source a change to one file could
reach, on average, following them all the way, is a design's propagation
cost (MacCormack, Rusnak and Baldwin, 2006); set the size to reach, and the
picture shows each file's.

::tangle-reach

A source that grows by features, which only the list of features needs,
sees it fall: a change inside a new feature can reach little beyond it. How far changes did go,
rather than could, is on [how this site changes](/projects/changes/).

## The arrows point one way

A rule written in a document is a rule that can be missed, by a person or by
an AI. So the rules of this code are not in a document: they are tests it has
to pass. `architecture.test.ts` reads the same graph this picture draws, and
fails when

- a file outside a folder named `browser/` touches the page,
- the frame imports a feature,
- two boxes need each other round in a circle,
- a file exports more than one value,
- a feature is missing from the diagrams in `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

The dashed arrows need only a type: a box that depends on an interface, not
on what implements it. That is dependency inversion, and it is what lets a
feature be removed by removing its folder.

## 8 September 2026

On its first day the source was sorted by kind of file: a `core` and a `ui`.
On the second it was sorted by what the site is — a frame, and the features
standing in it — in one commit: *The folders say what the site is, not what
kind of file each one holds*. Drag the slider back to it and watch the files
cross.
