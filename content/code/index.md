# Two public APIs  
of AngularJS  
are mine.

`$compileProvider.commentDirectivesEnabled()` and
`$compileProvider.cssClassDirectivesEnabled()` went into the AngularJS
compiler on 8 August 2016 -- 1,115 lines across eight files -- and they were
never taken out. They shipped in 1.5.9 and 1.6.0 that same year, and six years
of releases later they are still in 1.8.3, the last one the framework had, in
April 2022. The commit message says what
they were for: *this can result in a compilation speed-up of around 10%*. They
are [in the compiler](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/compile.js)
today; [the change itself](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/4c2964d01b55ebb279ea526ae9f44343e513bb8f)
and [the argument that got it in](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14850) are both there to read.

```js
app.config(function ($compileProvider) {
  // Nobody writes directives as comments or classes
  // any more: stop the compiler looking for them.
  $compileProvider.commentDirectivesEnabled(false);
  $compileProvider.cssClassDirectivesEnabled(false);
});
```

## Where I worked

Not on the documentation. Of the lines I put into AngularJS, thirty-four are
documentation, and they describe the option I had just added. The rest went
into the parts of a framework that people are careful about letting you touch:

The compiler :: Two performance changes in `src/ng/compile.js`, both listed under *Performance Improvements* in the changelog, in [1.5.8](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14848) and [1.5.9](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14850). Both still in the released bundle.
`ngClass` :: [A fix to how it watches](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14405), in 1.5.5 and backported to 1.4.11. [A test suite](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/7b2ed4ae41956656079c6e411ccf4012aaf611f6). [A benchmark](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/15243). And [the idea and much of the implementation](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14404) behind the rewrite that shipped in 1.6.1 -- the one with the big number.
The testing module :: [The implementation](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/72b96ef57a28743e2dfed523701cc2e88e3b473b) of `$componentController`, the helper `ngMock` gives you to unit-test a component's controller without compiling any DOM. Mine since 1.5.0-rc.1, and still mine, verbatim, in 1.8.3.
The benchmarks :: Two benchpress suites, [`bootstrap-compile-bp`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/tree/master/benchmarks/bootstrap-compile-bp) and [`ng-class-bp`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/tree/master/benchmarks/ng-class-bp), both written because a maintainer asked for numbers he could check. Both still in the repository.
A directive :: [`ngRef`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ng/directive/ngRef.js), which I [proposed as `ngAs`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14080) in February 2016 and which [shipped](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/bf841d35120bf3c4655fde46af4105c85a0f1cdc) in June 2018 with my name in the commit.

## The compiler

A maintainer asked, reasonably, for numbers he could check. So I wrote a
benchmark for the compiler in benchpress -- AngularJS's own measuring harness --
and posted what it said: about 12% off compiling Bootstrap's carousel template,
about 10% off its theme. Ten per cent is what this change is worth, and I have
seen much larger figures attributed to me for it. The large number is real, but
it belongs further down this page and to a different change.

[The second compiler change](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/3aedb1a70d9f925cf866ed7ba07f59c7eb13baa3)
is smaller and I like it more: a `try/catch` inside the function that
collected comment directives was stopping V8 from optimising the whole
function, so I moved it into a function of its own. Nineteen lines, and
measured on a customer's code over two hundred runs, [about 5% off parsing
and compiling](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14848). It shipped in 1.5.8. The comment I left
explaining why is still in the source.

## ngClass, and the hundredfold number

`ng-class="{lent: book.lendTo}"` needs exactly one thing from `book.lendTo`:
whether it is there. But `lendTo` might be a person, and a person has books,
and those books have people. AngularJS was deep-watching the expression --
copying that whole graph and comparing the copy -- on every digest, for every
element on the page. The cost was proportional to your data, and as I wrote in
the pull request at the time, the data could be big enough to take seconds to
copy.

Everyone who knew this wrote the second line instead, so the watcher saw a
boolean:

```html
<!-- copies the person, their books, their people -->
<li ng-class="{ lent: book.lendTo }">

<!-- copies true -->
<li ng-class="{ lent: !!book.lendTo }">
```

Everyone who did not know spent the afternoon finding out why the page had
frozen, and the answer was a `!!` somebody had forgotten -- or had never heard
of. The fix makes the first line cost what the second one does, so the `!!`
stopped being a thing you had to know. That is the whole of it, and it is why
it was worth months.

It shipped in 1.6.1, in [a commit](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b82097085d53ad89940828d3c0825518569b1e4a)
written by another maintainer on top of [mine](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14404), and the
changelog entry for it links to my pull request. His commit message:

> "In large based on #14404. Kudos to @drpicox for the initial idea and a big
> part of the implementation." -- Georgios Kalpakas, [in the commit that shipped it](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/b82097085d53ad89940828d3c0825518569b1e4a)

He asked for a benchmark, so I wrote that too: [`ng-class-bp`](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/15243),
reviewed and merged into AngularJS's own benchmark suite, where it still is.
It has the case twice: once written the way everyone writes it, and once with
the `!!`. On a single element bound to a large object the fix
measured **more than a hundred times faster** -- about 1.5 milliseconds a
digest down to between 0.02 and 0.08, which is to say down to what the `!!`
had been buying by hand. On long lists, five to ten times, from seven or
thirteen milliseconds down to about one.

Those are the numbers I posted, from the framework's benchmark, and the
maintainers took them and shipped the change. The same benchmark also says
that on data already written the careful way, by hand, the new code is about
25% *slower*. Which is the honest summary of the whole thing:
it does automatically what an experienced Angular programmer would have done
manually, and it is worth having for the same reason type inference is.

## The testing module

`$componentController` is how you unit-test an AngularJS component: give it
the component's name and it hands you the controller, with its bindings,
without compiling a template or touching the DOM. It is the API the component
guide teaches.

```js
it("greets", inject(function ($componentController) {
  var bindings = { name: "Ada" };
  var hello = $componentController("hello", {}, bindings);
  expect(hello.text()).toBe("Hello, Ada");
}));
```

I did not invent it. A maintainer added it on 10 January 2016. Two days later I
rewrote how it worked, for two reasons. His version kept a registry inside the
production compiler purely so that a test helper could read it -- test-only
code in `angular.min.js` -- and mine derives the same thing from the injector,
entirely inside the testing module. And if two directives shared a name, his
picked whichever had been registered last; mine filters for the one that is a
component, and refuses if there is not exactly one. That second point came out
of [the review](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/13732), where the objection to my version turned out
to be a bug in the existing one, and the design that settled it is the code
that shipped.

It shipped in 1.5.0-rc.1, so the production bundle never carried the extra
bytes in any public release, and it is the implementation in
`angular-mocks.js` at 1.8.3, comments included. It is [there
today](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/src/ngMock/angular-mocks.js).

## ngRef, and how long it took

`ngRef` publishes a controller, or an element, into scope, so that the template
around a component can talk to it:

```html
<todo-list ng-ref="todos"></todo-list>
<p>{{ todos.remaining() }} left</p>
```

I [proposed it](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14080) on 18
February 2016. It was discussed for two years and three months and
fifty-eight comments. On 1 June 2018 my pull request was closed. Four days
later a maintainer [opened his own](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/16511), rebased from mine with two
changes, and merged that.
The directive shipped in 1.7.1 three days after that. His commit message:

> "Thanks to @drpicox for the original implementation: PR #14080." -- Martin Staffa, [in the commit](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/bf841d35120bf3c4655fde46af4105c85a0f1cdc)

## Whose name is on the commit

There is no count of anything on this page, and this is why. On that project a
maintainer would take your pull request, rebase it, and land it himself:

> "@drpicox I can also make these changes, so just tell me if you'll do it or I
> should. :)" -- Martin Staffa, [July 2016](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/14850#issuecomment-234206359)

Every commit of mine on the main branch was put there by a maintainer's hand,
and GitHub records almost all of my pull requests as never merged -- two of
them my own scaffolding for another. The merge button measures who pressed it.
What it does not measure, one of them wrote down while turning down a different
idea of mine:

> "But totally 👍 for all the great ideas and work that you've been putting in
> to this and other features lately-ish. Really great stuff!" -- Georgios Kalpakas, [September 2016](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/pull/15112)

## Elsewhere

- [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/pull/1177) -- merged.
- [ducks-modular-redux](https://github.com/erikras/ducks-modular-redux) -- merged,
  and the canonical repository for the Ducks pattern lists two of my
  implementations in its README: `ducks-reducer` and `ducks-middleware`.
- Merged, too, into webpack's documentation site, `rollupify`, `kata-log`,
  `jest-runner-eslint` and `fetch-intercept`.
