  of a web page.

CCS3 is an evolution from the CSS 
and improves the capacity to visualize web pages.
It solves many of the traditional graphic effects 
which were performed with images, making
loading faster and improving the crawling.

CCS3 describes how each HTML component
has to be visualized
(typeface, spaces, boxes, shadows, sizes...),
and it is able to adapt this visualization for each device.
It allows to visualize the same web page
different for PC, for mobile, and 
even for a printer.

CSS3 is wide spread in the design domain
and it does not requires high specialization to use.

Nowadays there are lots of open *templates*,
like Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation, that
allow to get professional designs in no time,
even when the designer is not a professional.
