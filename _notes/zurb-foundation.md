HTML and CSS3 have many options to
make great presentations. 
Although this, start a design from scratch
and make presentations suitable for all screens
is difficult.
Zurb Foundation gives a full set of
styles and utilities that helps to 
create a good design.

Zurb Foundation is written
in SASS/SCSS, and can be used
directly as CSS3.
Currently it is used in many
web pages and have a high
degree of integration with jQuery.

The strong point of 
Zurb Foundation is that it can
be configured quickly
to create a corporative image
in no time. It also can be
personalized through graphic
re-suable components.
