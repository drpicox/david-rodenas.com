  to build advanced CSS3 designs.
  
---
CSS3 have many options and features,
but it has a low degree of reusability.
SASS is designed as a language
designed to ease and improve
CSS3 writting.

SASS is a Ruby program that
given SASS files
it builds for you a CSS3 files
that can be used directly in any web or app.
The strong points is that
it allows to use functions and variables.
It also has connectors to integrate
it directly with Ruby servers or
other technologies like NodeJS or GruntJS.

SASS language is similar to Ruby language
which makes code cleaner and easier to understand.
In addition it also defines the SCSS
which is exactly like CSS3 but 
it allows to use all SASS features.
It makes easier the migration from CSS3 
to SASS/SCSS.
