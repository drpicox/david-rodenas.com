  Memcached is a query accelerator for databases.

Reading data from a database is a slow operation
(it has to read from hard disk which is slow).
Memcached offsers a shared memory space service where 
multiple apps can store temporal results,
and reuse them later 
(saving time).

Memcached can be used as a library or as a server.
An app can use it remotely through REST.
The key point is that it can be used as a shared
memory between multiple apps and it
scales very well.
