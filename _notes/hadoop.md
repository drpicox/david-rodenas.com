Hadoop is the first real big-data available data base
and queries are built using map/reduce.
It uses a specific file system 
(Hadoop File System) 
which allows to use 
replica and distribution of data
across a large number of computers
simultaneously.

Hadoop has many tools, 
including HBase and Hive,
which allows to emulate a kind of SQL.
