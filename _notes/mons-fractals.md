Mons fractals is a 3D planet generator implemented
in Java using fractal algorithms.
A generator of a 3D world implemented in Java with fractal algorithms.

The algorithm works with one collection of triangles with properties
which is transformed by a stack of filters until obtain a planet.
It has its own GUI to select which filters to stack and with which
parameters. The output is a 
[VRML 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VRML) file.

This project was created as a student of the degree of Informatics Engineer
with other two partners.
