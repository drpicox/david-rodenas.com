  An environment to build
  multi-platform mobile apps
  (Android, iOS, Windows, ...).

---
Phonegap is a wrapper that allows
to build applications able to run
in multiple devices.

The idea of phonegap is to use the exact
same app and code in all environments:
mobile and web.
Apps are built like any web page
(html5 + css3 + js)
and it provides special hooks to make
it work as a web page or as
a native mobile or tablet app.

Currently Phonegap is able to build apps for
iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry, Symbian, Bada and Webos.
