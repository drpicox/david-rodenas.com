Usually web games are implemented through canvas.
This project is a small game of lunar landing
implemented directly with the html DOM, without
using canvas or any image.

It uses the [GogoMakePlay](http://gogomakeplay.com/){:target="_blank"} engine
which is double licenced: MIT and GPLv2 licenses.

This project was built some years ago
in few hours just to test some javascript game engine.
