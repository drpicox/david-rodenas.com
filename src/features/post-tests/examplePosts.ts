# Hello Blog

You can find here the blog.
The blog is a contract, between you, the player, and me, the maker of this game.

## How to use the blog

The blog is available in the application, and you can arrive through the header.

 * Go to the blog section,
 * You should see a list of posts,
 * The last post title should be "Hello Blog", this post
 * Go to the "Hello Blog" post,
 * You should see the "Hello Blog" post
 * The post should contain "this text", which is here.

_Thanks for the read._

# Ideas Have XP

The more you practice an idea, more skilled you become.
So get ready to accumulate experience points.

## Increasing XP

When the game begins, the XP in any idea is zero.

 * Enter the game.
 * There should be the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * The "Harvest Idea" should have 0 XP.

But when you start using them, the XP in the "Harvest Idea" idea should increase.

 * Draw a card from the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Move the "Harvest Idea" card to its own stack.
 * Move the "Villager" card on top of the "Harvest Idea" card.
 * Move the "Berry Bush" card on top of the "Villager" card.
 * There should be 1 stack of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * The "Harvest Idea" should have 1 XP.

### Gaining several XP at once

We won only one XP because there was only one use of the idea.
But what if we create two piles?

 * Given a new game.
 * Given there is the "Harvest Idea" idea.
 * Given there are 1 "Berry" cards.
 * Given there are 2 stacks of 1 "Harvest Idea", 1 "Villager", and 1 "Berry Bush" cards.
 * End the current moon.
 * The "Harvest Idea" should have 2 XP.
