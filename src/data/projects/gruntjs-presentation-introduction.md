## Overview

This is the **project** of a web page which is a kind
of prezi explaining the basics of *GruntJS*.

What makes special this project is that is a webpage
build with grunt explaining how to use 
<resource-link basename="gruntjs"></resource-link>, and,
at the same time, it is an example of how to use grunt.

This presentation is built in the same style of prezi,
but is built entirely with Javascript and HTML.

### Event

This presentation was part of the speech that I gave
the 6th of July in the [BarcelonaJS](http://barcelonajs.org) group. 
There were around of 85 people attending to the event.
