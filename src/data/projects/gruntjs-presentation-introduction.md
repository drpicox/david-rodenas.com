This is the project of a web page which is a kind
of prezi explaining the basics of *GruntJS*.

What makes special this project is that is a webpage
build with grunt explaining how to use GruntJS, and,
at the same time, it is an example of how to use grunt.

This presentation is built in the same style of prezi,
but is built entirely with Javascript and HTML.

This presentation was part of the speech that I gave
the 6th of July in the [BarcelonaJS](http://barcelonajs.org) group. 
There were around of 85 people attending to the event.
