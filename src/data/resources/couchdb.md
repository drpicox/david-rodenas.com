CouchDB is a highly scalable NoSQL database.
It does not support complex queries, 
like sorting elements, 
but it relays in map-reduce operations to overcome initial limitations.
CouchDB is designed to be just like a REST service
and it is integrated with
<resource-link basename="memcached"></resource-link>.
