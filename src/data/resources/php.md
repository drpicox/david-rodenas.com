  El PHP is the server language more extended
  and with more applications in the net.

PHP was designed as a language to 
write server side dynamic HTML pages
(change the content of a web page according a data base).
There are lots of apps created with PHP:
Wordpress, el Magento, Drupal, Facebook, ...

Although it is very easy to find
skilled programmers in PHP
nowadays PHP is considered to be going out of favor
because it is designed to build web pages in serverside
instead of browserside
(it makes loading times and browsing slower).

    :::php
	&lt;html&gt;
	  &lt;head&gt;
	    &lt;title&gt;Hello World!</title>
	  &lt;/head&gt;
	  &lt;body&gt;
	    &lt;?php echo "Hello World!\n"; ?&gt;
	  &lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;
