  Cassandra is a key/value database
  focused to big-data
  and high speed writes.
  
---
Cassandra is designed to work as a big-data in cluster nodes.
Cassandra design is focused in fast writes
(like a event/visit/... log) and at the same time to offer
all the capacities of replication and fail tolarance.
It has eventual consistency and has
operations of map/reduce for complex queries.

Cassandra is oriented to be used as a replacement
of a traditional database. 
Its infrastructure allows to replicate automatically the database
across many data-centers around the world automatically,
and at the same time, it can use itself as a backup.
The main objective is the performance and data reliability.
