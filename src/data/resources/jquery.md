  jQuery is a Javascript library
  to query and update an HTML web page.

---
jQuery has been one of the most
used and extended libraries to 
make web pages dynamic (client side).
Many times, AJAX has been synonym of jQuery.

jQuery is a javascript library which enables
queries over a web page, 
it is like the web page itself is a database.
The key point of jQuery are its ability to use
the same CSS selectors to find elements,
the posibility to chain calls,
and bulk operations over sets of results.

Nowadays it is the framework wich has more
libraries and utilities.
In the other hand, 
new frameworks like AngularJS 
makes jQuery practically obsolete.

    :::javascript
	$("p").text("Hello World!");
