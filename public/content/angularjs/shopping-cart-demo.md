# AngularJS 1.4 Shopping Cart Demo

A example of a shopping Cart
build in Angular 1.4 showing
good practices.

- **website**: http://david-rodenas.com/angular-shopping-cart-demo
- **source**: https://github.com/drpicox/angular-shopping-cart-demo

```html
Cart
<span ng-if="vm.cart.count">
  ({{vm.cart.count}})
</span>
```

This is an example ready to clone and start coding of good practices
in Angular 1.4.

Because Angular 1.5 introduces components and input bindings some
concepts are obsolete. 
Now there are more simple and maintainable ways to create the same demo.
