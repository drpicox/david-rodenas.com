# Ethics and the Software Craftsmanship Manifesto

The [Agile Manifesto](/ethics/agile-manifesto) is a good starting point, but many programmers have
seen that it is not good enough. They see it as the first step to create
confidence, but they belive that the professional must go beyond that.

The Software Craftsmanship Manifesto proposes professionals and customers
collaborate as partners, sharing success and failure.

Because of it, they made the
[Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/):

- Not only working software, but also **well-crafted software**.
- Not only responding to change, but also **steadily adding value**.
- Not only individuals and interactions, but also **a community of
  professionals**.
- Not only customer collaboration, but also **productive partnerships**.
