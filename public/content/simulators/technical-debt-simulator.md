# Technical Debt Simulator

This interactive simulator demonstrates the compound effect of technical debt on software development productivity. It shows how taking shortcuts initially saves time but creates accumulating interest that slows down future development.

## How It Works

The simulator models two development approaches:

1. **Clean Development**: Consistent pace, no shortcuts, steady productivity
2. **Debt-Driven Development**: Initial speed boost from shortcuts, but compound slowdown over time

## Key Concepts

### Time Savings vs. Compound Interest

- **Initial Shortcuts**: Taking shortcuts can reduce development time by 20-60% initially
- **Technical Debt Interest**: Each shortcut creates debt that compounds with a configurable interest rate
- **Break-Even Point**: The moment when clean development overtakes debt-driven development in total features delivered

### Real-World Implications

This simulation models what happens in real software projects:

- Skipping tests, documentation, or proper design patterns
- Quick fixes instead of proper solutions
- Accumulated code complexity that slows down future changes
- The hidden cost of maintaining poorly structured code

### Understanding the Charts

1. **Cumulative Features**: Shows total features delivered over time for both approaches
2. **Monthly Delivery Rate**: Shows the decreasing productivity of debt-driven development as debt accumulates

## Experiment with Different Scenarios

Try adjusting the parameters to see how different factors affect the outcome:

- **Base Time**: How long it takes to implement a feature properly
- **Shortcuts**: How much time shortcuts save initially (as a percentage)
- **Interest Rate**: How much each piece of technical debt slows down future development
- **Timeline**: How far into the future to project the simulation

## Lessons Learned

The simulator typically shows that:

1. **Short-term gains become long-term losses**: Initial productivity boosts are eventually overtaken by compound slowdown
2. **Clean development wins over time**: Consistent, quality development practices pay off in the long run
3. **Interest rate matters**: High technical debt interest (poor code quality) dramatically impacts future productivity
4. **Early investment pays off**: The sooner you invest in quality, the greater the long-term benefits

This tool helps visualize why investing in code quality, testing, and proper architecture is not just good practiceâ€”it's economically beneficial for any project with a longer timeline.
