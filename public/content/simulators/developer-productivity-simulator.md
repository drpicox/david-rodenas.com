# Developer Productivity Simulator

This interactive simulator demonstrates how individual focus levels, fatigue accumulation, and meeting schedules affect project productivity and feature delivery over multiple weeks.

## How It Works

The simulator models project work based on:

1. **Focus & Fatigue Balance**: Hourly productivity = normalize(focus - fatigue)
2. **Meeting Impact**: Different meeting types modify focus and fatigue levels
3. **Feature Completion**: Features complete when accumulated work reaches the feature size
4. **Weekly Patterns**: Simulates Monday-Friday work weeks with 8-hour days

## Interactive Simulation

## Core Mechanics

### Focus and Fatigue System

- **Base Focus**: Your starting focus level each hour (0 to 100)
- **Base Fatigue**: Your starting fatigue level each hour (0 to 100)
- **Hourly Productivity**: Calculated as `normalize(hourFocus - hourFatigue)` where normalize clamps values between 0-100
- **Accumulation**: Focus and fatigue accumulate throughout each day

### Meeting Types and Effects

The simulator includes three default meeting types that modify your focus and fatigue:

- **🍽️ Lunch**: Focus -100, Fatigue -100 (reduces fatigue, breaks focus)
- **🏃 Sprint plan**: Focus -100, Fatigue +50 (planning is mentally tiring)
- **😴 Boring**: Focus -50, Fatigue -25 (mild negative impact)

You can create custom meeting types with your own focus/fatigue values.

### Feature Completion Logic

```
For each work hour (non-meeting):
  hourFocus = normalize(hourFocus + baseFocus)
  hourFatigue = normalize(hourFatigue + baseFatigue)
  hourProductivity = normalize(hourFocus - hourFatigue)

  If hourProductivity >= remainingWork:
    Feature completes, focus resets to 0
  Else:
    Add hourProductivity to accumulated work
```

## Key Features

### Interactive Calendar

- **Drag and Drop**: Click and drag to schedule meetings across the week
- **5-Day Schedule**: Monday through Friday, 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM (8 hours)
- **Default Schedule**: Lunch meetings pre-scheduled at 12:00 PM daily
- **Meeting Types**: Select different meeting types and paint them on the calendar

### Real-Time Simulation

The simulator runs continuously, updating results as you change:
- Focus and fatigue sliders
- Feature size (complexity)
- Number of weeks to simulate
- Meeting schedule
- Meeting type parameters

### Metrics Dashboard

The simulator provides key productivity metrics:

1. **Completed Features**: Total features finished during simulation
2. **Final Accumulated Productivity**: `completedFeatures × featureSize`
3. **Average Hourly Productivity**: `finalAccumulatedProductivity ÷ totalHours`
4. **Total Hours Simulated**: `weeks × 5 days × 8 hours`

### Weekly Summary Chart

Interactive bar chart showing:
- **Daily Productivity** (blue bars, left axis): Total productivity accumulated each day of the week
- **Features Completed** (green bars, right axis): Number of features finished each day
- **Dual Y-axes**: Properly scaled for different metrics

## Configuration Parameters

### Primary Controls

- **Focus (0 to 100)**: Your base focus level added each work hour
- **Fatigue (0 to 100)**: Your base fatigue level added each work hour
- **Feature Size (0 to 1000)**: How much work each feature requires
- **Weeks (1 to 16)**: Duration of the simulation

### Meeting Configuration

- **Meeting Type Selector**: Choose which type of meeting to schedule
- **Focus/Fatigue Editing**: Modify the impact of each meeting type
- **Custom Meeting Types**: Create new meeting types with custom names and effects
- **Color Coding**: Each meeting type has a distinct color on the calendar

## Experiment with Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: High Focus, Low Fatigue
- Set Focus: 75, Fatigue: 10
- Minimal meetings
- Observe high daily productivity and frequent feature completions

### Scenario 2: Meeting-Heavy Schedule
- Add multiple "Boring" meetings throughout each day
- Watch how negative focus impacts reduce productivity
- Notice the compound effect on feature delivery

### Scenario 3: Strategic Lunch Breaks
- Default lunch meetings help by reducing fatigue (-100)
- Try removing lunches and see productivity suffer from fatigue buildup
- Experiment with different lunch meeting focus/fatigue values

### Scenario 4: Sprint Planning Impact
- Schedule sprint planning meetings on Mondays
- Observe how the fatigue boost (+50) affects the week
- Compare with spreading planning throughout the week

## Understanding the Results

### Weekly Patterns

The weekly summary chart reveals patterns like:
- **Monday Blues**: Lower productivity due to week startup
- **Mid-week Peak**: Highest productivity on Tuesday-Thursday
- **Friday Falloff**: Reduced output as the week ends
- **Meeting Impact**: Days with many meetings show lower productivity

### Feature Completion Timing

- Features complete when accumulated productivity reaches the feature size
- Larger features require sustained productivity over multiple days
- Meeting interruptions delay feature completion
- Focus resets after each feature completion, requiring momentum rebuilding

### Productivity Optimization

The simulator typically shows:
1. **Fatigue Management**: Negative fatigue (breaks, rest) improves long-term productivity
2. **Focus Protection**: Minimizing negative focus meetings preserves productivity
3. **Meeting Timing**: Strategic placement of disruptive meetings matters
4. **Work Rhythm**: Consistent daily patterns often outperform erratic schedules

## Real-World Applications

This simulation models common project management scenarios:

- **Sprint Planning**: How often should teams meet for planning?
- **Meeting Fatigue**: The cost of excessive meetings on delivery
- **Work-Life Balance**: Benefits of proper breaks and lunch scheduling
- **Team Capacity**: Understanding realistic feature delivery timelines
- **Schedule Optimization**: Finding the best meeting patterns for your team

Use the simulator to test different approaches before implementing them with your actual team!
