# Developer Productivity Simulator

This interactive simulator demonstrates how meetings, interruptions, and focus time affect developer productivity. It shows how focus grows exponentially during uninterrupted work periods and how different types of meetings impact overall feature delivery.

## How It Works

The simulator models developer productivity based on:

1. **Focus Growth**: Focus increases exponentially while working on tasks without interruption
2. **Meeting Impact**: Different meeting types have different multipliers on focus levels
3. **Daily Reset**: Focus resets at the start of each day
4. **Feature Completion**: Focus resets when features are completed

## Key Concepts

### Focus and Flow State

- **Exponential Growth**: Developer focus grows exponentially during uninterrupted work
- **Context Switching Cost**: Meetings and interruptions reduce focus and productivity
- **Daily Rhythm**: Focus naturally resets each day, requiring time to rebuild

### Meeting Types and Impact

The simulator includes different meeting types with varying productivity impacts:

- **Lunch (×1.0)**: Maintains current focus level - necessary break
- **Next Feature Planning (×0.0)**: Completely resets focus - major context switch
- **Other Meetings (×0.5)**: Reduces focus by half - general productivity loss

### Time Management Strategies

Experiment with different calendar configurations to see how meeting placement affects:

- Total weeks to complete the project
- Average work completed per hour
- Features delivered per week
- Percentage of time spent actually working

## Real-World Implications

This simulation models common workplace scenarios:

- **Meeting-Heavy Days**: See how back-to-back meetings destroy productivity
- **Focus Blocks**: Observe the benefits of protecting large blocks of uninterrupted time
- **Meeting Scheduling**: Learn optimal times to schedule different types of meetings
- **Context Switching**: Understand the hidden cost of frequent interruptions

### Understanding the Results

The simulator provides several key metrics:

1. **Weeks to Complete**: Total time needed to finish all features
2. **Avg Work/Hour**: How much actual work gets done per working hour
3. **Avg Features/Week**: Feature delivery rate over time
4. **Time Working**: Percentage of total time spent on productive work

### Charts and Visualization

- **Focus Level Over Time**: Shows how focus builds and gets interrupted throughout the simulation
- **Features Completed per Week**: Demonstrates the impact of meeting patterns on delivery velocity

## Experiment with Different Scenarios

Try these configurations to see their impact:

### Scenario 1: Meeting-Free Mornings
- Schedule all meetings in the afternoon
- Protect morning hours for deep work
- Observe how sustained focus improves productivity

### Scenario 2: Meeting-Heavy Schedule
- Add multiple meetings throughout each day
- See how context switching destroys productivity
- Notice the compound effect of lost focus time

### Scenario 3: Strategic Planning Days
- Concentrate "Next Feature Planning" meetings on specific days
- Compare with spreading planning throughout the week
- Observe how batching similar meetings helps

## Configuration Parameters

Adjust these settings to model different project scenarios:

- **Total Features**: The scope of your project (5-50 features)
- **Work per Feature**: Complexity of each feature (10-100 work units)
- **Focus Growth Factor**: How quickly developers enter flow state (1.1x - 2.0x)

## Lessons Learned

The simulator typically reveals:

1. **Protected Focus Time**: Large blocks of uninterrupted time are exponentially more valuable
2. **Meeting Placement**: Strategic scheduling of meetings can dramatically improve productivity
3. **Context Switching Cost**: The hidden cost of interruptions is higher than most people realize
4. **Compound Effect**: Small changes in meeting patterns can have large impacts on delivery

This tool helps visualize why protecting developer focus time and being strategic about meeting scheduling is crucial for team productivity and project success.
