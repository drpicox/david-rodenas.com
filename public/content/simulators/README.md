# Software Development Simulators

Welcome to my collection of interactive simulators designed to help developers understand complex software development concepts through hands-on experimentation.

## Available Simulators

### [Technical Debt Simulator](/simulators/technical-debt-simulator)
An interactive tool that demonstrates how shortcuts in software development create compound productivity losses over time. Explore different scenarios to understand:

- The true cost of technical debt
- How initial time savings can lead to long-term productivity losses
- The break-even point between clean and debt-driven development
- The impact of different interest rates on technical debt

### [Developer Productivity Simulator](/simulators/developer-productivity-simulator)
A comprehensive simulation that models how meetings, focus, and fatigue affect developer productivity over time. Features include:

- Interactive weekly calendar for scheduling different types of meetings
- Real-time productivity calculations based on focus and fatigue levels
- Visual heat maps showing hourly productivity patterns
- Customizable meeting types with configurable focus/fatigue impacts
- Multi-week productivity analysis and feature completion tracking

## Why Simulators?

Software development concepts like technical debt, scalability bottlenecks, and team dynamics are often abstract and hard to visualize. These simulators provide:

- **Visual Learning**: See concepts in action with real-time charts and metrics
- **Interactive Exploration**: Adjust parameters to test different scenarios
- **Concrete Understanding**: Transform abstract concepts into tangible insights
- **Decision Support**: Help make informed decisions about development practices

## More Simulators Coming Soon

Stay tuned for additional simulators covering topics like:
- Team scaling and communication overhead
- Deployment frequency vs. stability
- Code complexity and maintenance costs
- Testing coverage and bug detection rates
