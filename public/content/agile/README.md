# Agile Development

Agile development is a set of methodologies that emphasize flexibility, collaboration, and customer feedback. It's an approach to software development that values:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

## Key Agile Resources

- [Waterfall vs Agile](/agile/waterfall-vs-agile) - Understanding the differences between traditional and agile approaches
- [Agile Manifesto](/ethics/agile-manifesto) - The foundational document of the agile movement

Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, XP (Extreme Programming), and others, each with their own practices but sharing the core agile values.
