    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
    PhD., Engineer and Vicedean at the Official Catalan CS Society and CS enthusiastic who loves to innovate and extract all potential to this young technology.
    </p>
    <p>
    I was born in Barcelona in 1978 and raised in Montgat, 
    a small town near Barcelona. 
    I started to write programs when I was 8 years old, 
    with a ZX Spectrum and a book called "Basic para ni&ntilde;os".
    Before the university I wrote some complex programs,
    including a simple neuronal net, or a 3D raytracer.
    The university was for me like an <em>all you can eat</em>,
    full of rich concepts and challenges.
    </p>
    <p>
    Nowadays I am a Freelance Code Architect, 
    Vicedean of Professional Development at the Official Catalan CS Society
    and an active member of many meetups. 
    Inside meetup community I have a say:
    <em>"If you have learned something interesting, make a speech and share it"</em>.
    I am also a close follower of the Agile movement,
    software quality, testing, ... and all those concepts that
    just starts to define what is to be a good professional in CS.
