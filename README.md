# David Rodenas homepage

This is the project of my homepage.

It is built taking advantage of the most new Javascript technologies
to create a fast and detailed home page, and very simple to mantain.

## Building

If you want to build, just execute:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ grunt server
  
Now you can open 
[localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) 
to see it working.

## Deployment

Grunt the `dist/` directory and copy it to your server.

    $ grunt dist
