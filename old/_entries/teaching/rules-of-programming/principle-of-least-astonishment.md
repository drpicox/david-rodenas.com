The system architecture should be:

- homogenous
- isotropic 
- consistent
- repetitive (not surprising)

It does not matter where we look in the code, 
it should alsways look the same.

Editing an unknown part of the application for you,
should be no problem, everything works the same.

A little more boilerplate to follow always the same rules,
should be no problem, write is cheap, think is expensive, 
understand is critical.
