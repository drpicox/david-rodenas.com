## Motivation

For a long time people told to me that the good job of jQuery is that anyone without Javascript knowledge can create a layout and then, later, give it life without explicit directives.

Here I present five scenarios in which jQuery and AngularJS are able to create the same behavior from layouts without any AngularJS directive.

It is also a very good starting point for those jQuery experts who want to start understanding the AngularJS way.
