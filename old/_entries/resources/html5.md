  HTML5 is a language that describes
  the contents of a web page.

HTML was born as a language to 
describe documents which link to other documents
(this is the basis of WWW).
From its first definition, 
to the current HTML5 version, 
it has evolved to add new options and functionalities.

Nowadays HTML5 is used as a platform
to build the visualization of apps
(using a web as a *window* of an app),
in addition it enables technologies
like CSS3, javascript, databases,
photo capture, GPS, 3D graphics,
network connections...

As a matter of fact HTML5 
is like a complete operating system,
able to be executed graphical apps
either in desktops and mobile
(iOS, Android, Windows, Blackberry, 
symbian, bada, webos).
