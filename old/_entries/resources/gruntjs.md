Usually web apps and web pages
are composed of many files.
Although create many files is good
to obtain a high degree of re-usability 
and ease of maintenance,
it works against loading time and latency.
GruntJS, once configured,
allows to join all files and compress the result
in a single command.

In addition to join and compress files,
GruntJS also is ready to do other tasks like:

- real time visualization of changes,
- creation of derived contents,
- applying templates,
- creation of timestamps to improve cache performance,
- automatic creation of mobile app manifest,
- real time code review,
- execution of tests in real-time
- ...
