  Markdown is a content format 
  which can be translated to HTML.

---
HTML is based in marks in which each mark 
defines a part of the document
Markdown gives an alternative to write documents,
based on plain text, which is converted into Html with marks.

Markdown is very used in the web 
to create contents and manuals quickly.
Using GruntJS, 
it can be used to create static content document data bases
for web or app contents.
