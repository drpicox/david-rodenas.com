  Twitter Bootstrap is a template
  to create web page and apps
  designs.

HTML and CSS3 have many options
to create great designs,
but, start from scratch or
build designs for all devices,
is difficult and requires a great effort.
Twitter Bootstrap gives a large list
of utilities and components
that helps to create high quality designs.

Twitter Bootstrap is written in lesscss,
but it can be used directly as CSS3
and there is also a SASS version available.
Currently there are many pages and apps using it,
and even AngularJS has many tools
for its integration.

The best strength is that
Twitter Bootstrap can be configured
quickly to mimic a corporative image.
