Doing fast web pages is a big challenge, and our objective is to achieve a page load of 1000ms, just one second!

This presentation covers all the layers involved in the processes, from the server til the human brain. 
It explains what is possible, what is not possible, 
which kind of tricks we can apply to make look our pages load faster 
but most important, 
how we can measure objectively our results and make sure that our improvements are good.

Presentation video is available in catalan here: [https://youtu.be/uPcqPFdBv0c](https://youtu.be/uPcqPFdBv0c).
