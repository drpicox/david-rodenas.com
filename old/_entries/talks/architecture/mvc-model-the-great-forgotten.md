  After many consulting in my customers I have realized
  that only few people understand well what are models
  and what kind of problems they solve.
  This presentation makes a very good introduction to it.

MVC is a very popular model and many people claim that they follow it. 
But, despite of this, many people does not understand what are Models and which role are they playing. 

This presentation was done in the Angular Camp of January'2015, 
explains with AngularJS step by step what happens when we develop 
Applications and how Models solve a large list of potential problems. 

This presentation was very well received by the audience which had been 
very grateful and claimed to finally understand what models were for.
