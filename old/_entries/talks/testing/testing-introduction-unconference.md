  An improvised talk inside the AngularCamp of July 2016
  with an introduction to testing.
  I was very well received and I explained in 40 minutes
  the basics of why and what to tests, and 
  interactive tests with plnkr and the audience.

In the Angular-Camp of 2016 july 
there was an interest about testing but not talks about,
because of this, I was requested by the organizers
to do some kind of talk to introduce testing.

Because I already had some experience and previous material
I agree to do it.

As material I used a plnkr from a teaching session with 
my costumers, and also some of the marvelous slides of 
Mi≈°ko Hevery of the [hot wo write hard code to test](http://misko.hevery.com/2009/10/28/how-to-write-hard-to-test-code-what-to-look-for-when-reviewing-other-peoples-hard-to-test-code/)
presentation.

It was a completely success and they asked for more.
Later, in other meetups, I presented the formalization and
continuation of this talk.
