  A workshop in which each attendee reproduces
  the bowling kata.
  While I show what are the steps to follow,
  I explain and make understand the magic of TDD
  which allows to leverage in tests to refactor
  the code, and in the code to refactor the tests.
  The objective is to get clean, readable and 
  maintainable code.

I love this workshop. To complete it takes around 2~3 hours,
it depends in the level and previous experience of the attendees.

In this presentation I use the 
[Bowling Game Kata](http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.TheBowlingGameKata)
of the Uncle Bob, with the intention of making the assistants 
to learn more about Uncle Bob.

I have realized this workshop many times for my customers,
both in Javascript and Java (once in .NET for a small group).
