Robert C. Martin, in the book Clean Agile, explains the origin of Agile as one
of the founders of the manifesto and its intention. The book reviews the basics
of agile, common misconceptions, and how to fix them. But it also examines the
concept of ethics and professionalism.

Robert C. Martin proposes two bills of rights to regulate the profession, one
for customers, and the other for the professional.

## The Customer Bill Of Rights

According Robert C. Martin, these are the rights that the customer have, and the
professional must observe:

- You have the right to an overall plan and to know **what can be accomplished
  when and at what cost**.
- You have the right to get the **most possible value out of every iteration**.
- You have the right to see progress in a running system, **proven to work by
  passing repeatable tests** that you specify.
- You have the **right to change your mind**, to substitute functionality, and
  to change priorities without paying exorbitant costs.
- You have the right to be **informed of schedule and estimate changes**, in
  time to choose how to reduce the scope to meet a required date. You can cancel
  at any time and be left with a useful working system reflecting investment to
  date.

## The Professional Bill Of Rights

Robert C. Martin shows the customer's rights for the professional. The
professional should not submit his will to the customer; the professional knows
the product internals, and like a doctor, he is ultimately responsible for its
success. These are the rights that professionals have to ensure their job
quality and keep their reputation untouched:

- You have the right to know what is needed with **clear declarations of
  priority**.
- You have the right to produce **high-quality work at all times**.
- You have the **right to ask for and receive help** from peers, managers, and
  customers.
- You have the right to **make and update your own estimates**.
- You have the right to **accept your responsibilities** instead of having them
  assigned to you.
