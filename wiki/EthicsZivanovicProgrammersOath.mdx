---

Marko Zivanovic publishes at
(theprogrammersoath.com)[https://www.theprogrammersoath.com/] the followin oath:

> I swear by Ritchie, by Dijkstra, by Turing, and by all the gods and goddesses,
> making them my witness, that I will carry out, according to my ability and
> judgment, this oath and this indenture.
>
> Into whatsoever tribes I enter, I will enter to build a better world, and I
> will abstain from all intentional wrongdoing and harm, especially from abusing
> the minds of my fellow men by entrapping them with the outcome of my
> programming. I will not succumb to the pressure of my tribe to write code
> harmful to others, as the rights of the individual are above any tribe's wish
> for power or gold.
>
> I will not ever use dark patterns, and I will warn my brethren and sistren of
> the danger they pose. The way of my programming shall be the way of light, and
> I will always make sure the intentions of the scripts I write are clear to
> all, bond or free.
>
> I shall make it my life's quest to create only the best quality wares I am
> able to, and I will proudly stand behind my works. I will thirstily learn new
> ways to elevate my craft and I shall do so as long as I live the life of a
> programmer.
>
> Now, if I carry out this oath, and break it not, may I gain forever reputation
> among all men for my craft; but if I break it and forswear myself, may all my
> buffers overrun, and all the bits I ever write flip fortuitously!
