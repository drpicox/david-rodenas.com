title: Code Conventions
---

This article covers code conventions for the [ProjectsWith] project.

## Package dependences

Avoid circular dependencies between packages.

## Java Storage Repositories

Access to repositories only from the current package. All repositories
interfaces should be package private.

## Method/Function order

High level methods go first. Helper functions go below. See bowling kata as
example.

## If/For brackets

Both `if` and `for` statements should have no brackets. All content inside them
should be wrapped in a function.

```java
// avoid
if (isActive(card)) {
  cardController.pickCard()
  cardController.discardCard(card);
}

// recommended
if (isActive(card))
  runCardActivation(card):
```

## Do not use setXXX

Look for a better suited word that explains exactly what is going on and why the
value is set. Aka, do not expose how it is implemented.

```java
// avoid
card.setPile(NONE);

// recommended
card.discard();
```

## Injections by constructor

Avoid the use of spring `@Autowired`. Use always the constructor. The only
exception are JUnit Test Runner Post\_\*\_Test classes.
