Until recently, we, the programmers, did not though about the implications of
our developments. But nowadays, we cannot deny the implications of our
developments. It is not just of doing it right or wrong, is being not harmful.

The first thing that we, the programmers, have to be aware is that we rule the
world; literally. If you think about how many processors (hardware things that
need a software, so a programmer, to work), the number evades our imagination.
Just start thinking how many processors are in your home: the computer, the
mobile, the console, the TV, the fridge, the microwave, the oven, the
dishwasher, the washing machine, LED lights, remote controls, clocks, â€¦ and that
is just inside your home. The difference between politics and programmers is
while politics can write rules that can be broken or bend, the processor will
follow our rules to the letter. They are, like the laws of gravity, unbreakable.
And because of it, we, the programmers, rule the world.

As Uncle Ben would say: "With great power comes great responsibility.". A faulty
code can kill a person, a company, or your colleage career.
