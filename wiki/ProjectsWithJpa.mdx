Spring JPA automatically creates the code for the DDBB connection.

## JPA

JPA decouples Java implementation from Database connection

```java
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class Cacauet {
  @Id private String id;
  private int round;
}
```

### Annotations

Use annotations to describe how to connect Objects to Database rows.

Some of the annotations are:

- `@Entity`
- `@Id`
- `@OneToMany`
- `@ManyToOne`
- `@ManyToMany`

## @Entity

Describes one class as an entity that can be stored in a Database.

If you want to store in the database a new entity, add the `@Entity` annotation
in the class definition:

```java
@Entity
public class Game {
  /* ... */
}
```

> > **Important**: All entities must have `@Id`

### Entities and storage

Entity objects store all their private fields into the Database.

- Simple types (int, String, List&lt;String>, ...) are stored automatically
- Serializable: it serializes unkown Serializable objects directly to blobs.
- Other and your types needs help to store (requires annotations).

In this example it stores the name and the round:

```java
@Entity
public class Game {

  @Id private String name;
  private int round;

  /* ... */
}
```

## @Id

Describes which of the class fields is the primary key.

```java
@Entity
public class Game {

  @Id private String name;

  /* ... */
}
```

### @GeneratedValue

Use it with `@Id` when you want a new _random_ identifier for each new Entity.

```java
@Entity
public class Card  {
    @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;

    /* ... */
}
```

### @IdClass

Use another class as composite primary key.

```java
public class AccountId implements Serializable {
    private String accountNumber;
    private String accountType;

    /* ... + equals() + hashCode() */
}

@Entity
@IdClass(AccountId.class)
public class Account {
    @Id private String accountNumber;
    @Id private String accountType;

    /* ... */
}
```

## Relationships

<Mermaid>{`classDiagram
  class Player {
    name
  }
  class Game {
    name
    round
  }
  Player "*" --> "1" Game
`}</Mermaid>

### @ManyToOne

Use `@ManyToOne` to create one relationship from one entity to another entity,
when there are many of the current entity referencing the same other entity.

<slide-row>


```java
@Entity
public class Player {
  @Id
  private String name;

  @ManyToOne
  private Game game;

  /* ... */
}
```

<Mermaid>{`classDiagram
  class Player {
    name
    game
  }
  class Game {
    name
    round
  }
  Player "*" --> "1" Game
`}</Mermaid>

</slide-row>


### @OneToMany

Use `@OneToMany` to create one relationship from one entity to another entity,
when there the current entity has many references to the other entity.

<slide-row>


```java
@Entity
public class Game {
  @Id
  private String name;

  @OneToMany
  private List<Player> players;

  /* ... */
}
```

<Mermaid>{`classDiagram
  class Player {
    name
  }
  class Game {
    name
    round
    players
  }
  Player "*" <-- "1" Game
`}</Mermaid>

</slide-row>


> > Note that in the current implementation we have opted for the reverse
> > relationship, in order to decouple dependencies between packages.

> > We do not need this reverse relationship. See Repositories.

### @ManyToMany

Use this annotation when many entities connects to other many entities.

<slide-row>


```java
@Entity
public class Card {
  @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;

  @ManyToMany
  private List<Label> labels;

  /* ... */
}
```

<Mermaid>{`classDiagram
  class Card {
    id
    labels
  }
  class Label {
    name
  }
  Card "*" --> "*" Label
`}</Mermaid>

</slide-row>


### @OneToOne

Use this annotation when there is only one instance of this type of entity in
relationship with another.

<slide-row>


```java
@Entity
public class Bag {
  @Id private String username;

  @OneToOne
  private Player player;

  /* ... */
}
```

<Mermaid>{`classDiagram
  class Bag {
    username
    player
  }
  class Player {
    username
  }
  Bag "0..1" --> "1" Player
`}</Mermaid>

</slide-row>


### Relationships are between entities

You only can use:

- `@ManyToOne`
- `@OneToMany`
- `@ManyToMany`
- `@OneToOne`

## Inheritance

There are many strategies to save entities with inheritance.

<Mermaid>{`classDiagram
  class Item {
    name
  }
  class Food {
    name
    lifePoints
  }
  class Weapon {
    name
    damage
  }
  Item <|-- Food
  Item <|-- Weapon
`}</Mermaid>

### Joined Strategy

Stores each class in a different table.

```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.JOINED)
public class Item {
    @Id private String name;

    /* ... */
}

@Entity
public class Food extends Item {
    private int lifePoints;

    /* ... */
}
```

### SingleTable Strategy

```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.SINGLE_TABLE )
@DiscriminatorColumn( name = "type" )
public class Item {
    @Id private String name;

    /* ... */
}

@Entity
@DiscriminatorValue( value="food" )
public class Food extends Item {
    private int lifePoints;

    /* ... */
}
```

### TablePerClass Strategy

Tables for each entity, but with all the fields without joind and may have
nulls.

```java
@Entity
@Inheritance(strategy = InheritanceType.TABLE_PER_CLASS)
public class Item {
    @Id private String name;

    /* ... */
}

@Entity
public class Food extends Item {
    private int lifePoints;

    /* ... */
}
```

## @Embeddable

Embed other class attributes directly to your entity. Requires serializable.

```java
@Embeddable
public class Coordinates implements Serializable {
  private int x;
  private int y;
  /* ... */
}

@Entity
public class Ship {
  @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;
  @Embedded Coordinates coordinates;

  /* ... */
}
```

### @EmbeddedId

You can use Embedded as primary key for composite keys.

```java
@Entity
public class StarSystem {
  @EmbeddedId private Coordinates location;

  /* ... */
}
```

Please note that we have replaced `@Id` by `EmbeddedId`.

### Not embedd twice

You cannot embedd twice the same Embeddable.

```java
@Entity
public class MoveCommand {
  @Id @GeneratedValue private Long id;

  @Embedded Coordinates from;
  @Embedded Coordinates to;
  // ^ fails because the x,y fields are already present because `from`

}
```

> > Check for `@AttributeOverrides` if you really need it.

## Repositories

Access to the save instances through Repositories.

```java
interface CardRepository extends JpaRepository<Card, Long> {
}
```

> > Note that the first Generic parameter is the Entity the second is the
> > primary key type. The primary key type can be also the specified by an
> > @IdClass or @EmbeddedId.

### JpaRepository default methods

See:
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/jpa/repository/JpaRepository.html

Some methods:

- `findAll(): List<E>`: loads all saved entities from the database
- `findById(key: K): Optional<E>`: returns the entity corresponding to that key,
  if it exists
- `save(entity: E): E`: saves the current entity and returns it
- `delete(entity: E)`: deletes an entity from the database (note that the
  instance still exists until you loose the reference)

### Implementing JpaRepository

Spring automatically implements JpaRepository. All you have to do is to inject
it inside a @Component and Spring automatically implements and injects it:

```java
@Controller
public class CardController {
    private final CardRepository cardRepository;

    public CardController(CardRepository cardRepository) {
        this.cardRepository = cardRepository;
    }

    /* ... */
}
```

> > Note that it fails if some annotations are wrong. Please, read errors
> > carefully to discover which entity is wrong.

### Automatic Custom Queries

Spring implements automatically methods that are making queries on the database.

For example:

```java
interface CardRepository extends JpaRepository<Card, Long> {

    // see https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/1.5.0.RELEASE/reference/html/jpa.repositories.html
    List<Card> findByGame(Game game);
}
```

Looks for all Cards that has a relationship with that Game.

See naming rules here
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/1.5.0.RELEASE/reference/html/jpa.repositories.html

### Manual queries

It is possible to write manual queries. Do not use them on your assignment.

## Lifecycle

Entities have a lifecycle state graph about their relation with the database.
They can work without a database, or inside one.

<Mermaid>{`stateDiagram
    [*] --> New
    New --> Managed : persist
    Managed --> Removed: remove
    Removed --> Detached : clear/close
    Managed --> Detached : clear/close
    Removed --> Managed : persist
    state Database {}
    Database --> Managed : find/...
    Managed --> Database : flush/commit
    Removed --> Database : flush/commit
`}</Mermaid>{" "}

### Consistency

When you save an entity:

- Becomes managed
- Generate @GeneratedValue ids
- Updates relationships

## Database configuration

Use `application.properties` to configure the database:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE
spring.datasource.platform=h2
spring.datasource.username=sa
spring.datasource.password=
spring.datasource.driverClassName=org.h2.Driver
spring.jpa.database-platform=org.hibernate.dialect.H2Dialect

spring.h2.console.enabled=true
spring.h2.console.path=/h2-console
spring.h2.console.settings.trace=false
spring.h2.console.settings.web-allow-others=true

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto = create
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.show_sql=false
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.use_sql_comments=false
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=false
```

## Quirks

### Empty constructor

All JPA entities must have a public, protected, or package private, empty
constructor.

```java
@Entity
public class Game {

    @Id private String name;
    private int round;

    public Game(String gameName) {
        this.name = gameName;
        this.round = 1;
    }

    // JPA required
    protected Game() {}

    /* ... */
}
```

### Reserved words

Although JPA is vendor independent, it does not protect you to fail if you use a
name reserved by the database.

```java
@Embeddable
public class Coordinates implements Serializable {
    @Column(name = "aRow")
    private int row;
    @Column(name = "aColumn")
    private int column;

    /* ... */
}
```
