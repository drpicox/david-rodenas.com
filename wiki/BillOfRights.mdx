title: "Bill Of Rights"

In 2020, during the COVID confinement,
I was teaching Software Engineering 3 at the University.
I like the last day of class to be always different to
make students aware of their work's repercussions.
In that case and those circumstances,
I built a special presentation with all the contents and comments.
You can find the slides here:

- [ES3 Cloenda Slides](/docs/ES3-13-Cloenda.pdf)

It starts with real cases and
how ICT professionals impact the lives of other people.
And then it continues empowering them,
with rules and rights that they observe follow.

## TDD Rules

The first step is the three TDD rules. Three rules that every professional should observe to make sure that any product does exactly what he says:

- You are not allowed to write any production code unless it is to make a failing unit test pass.
- You are not allowed to write any more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail; and compilation failures are failures.
- You are not allowed to write any more production code than is sufficient to pass the one failing unit test.

## Agile Manifesto

The [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/) is the first attempt in the industry to create a conduct code between the professional and its customer. It seeks to create confidence between professionals and customers. It stats four simple statements:

- **Individuals and interactions**: over processes and tools
- **Working software**: over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration**: over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change**: over following a plan

To clarify those statements it presents the [twelve principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html)

## Software Craftsmanship Manifesto

But professionals had seen that the Agile Manifesto is not good enough, it is the first step to create confidence, but the professional must go beyond that. Professionals and customers must be partners and share success and failure. Because of it, they made the [Manifesto for Software Craftsmanship](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/):

- Not only working software, but also **well-crafted software**.
- Not only responding to change, but also **steadily adding value**.
- Not only individuals and interactions, but also **a community of professionals**.
- Not only customer collaboration, but also **productive partnerships**.

## The Customer Bill Of Rights

Robert C. Martin, in the book Clean Agile, explains the origin of Agile as one of the founders of the manifesto and its intention. The book reviews the basics of agile, common misconceptions, and how to fix them. But it also examines the concept of ethics and professionalism.

Robert C. Martin proposes two bills of rights to regulate the profession, one for customers, and the other for the professional. According him, these are the rights that the customer have, and the professional must observe:

- You have the right to an overall plan and to know **what can be accomplished when and at what cost**.
- You have the right to get the **most possible value out of every iteration**.
- You have the right to see progress in a running system, **proven to work by passing repeatable tests** that you specify.
- You have the **right to change your mind**, to substitute functionality, and to change priorities without paying exorbitant costs.
- You have the right to be **informed of schedule and estimate changes**, in time to choose how to reduce the scope to meet a required date. You can cancel at any time and be left with a useful working system reflecting investment to date.

## The Professional Bill Of Rights

In the book Clean Agile,
Robert C. Martin shows the customer's rights and the rights for the professional.
The professional should not submit his will to the customer;
the professional knows the product internals, and like a doctor,
he is ultimately responsible for its success. These are the rights that professionals have to ensure their job quality and keep their reputation untouched:

- You have the right to know what is needed with **clear declarations of priority**.
- You have the right to produce **high-quality work at all times**.
- You have the **right to ask for and receive help** from peers, managers, and customers.
- You have the right to **make and update your own estimates**.
- You have the right to **accept your responsibilities** instead of having them assigned to you.

## Addendum: The Catalan Case

On September 20th of 2017, in Catalonia,
the Spanish police raided multiple companies and held in custody incommunicated
for more than 48 hours several ICT professionals.
The Spanish were trying to prevent a referendum in Catalonia,
and they wanted to shut down many several services and domain names by force.
System administrators, developers,
and ICT professionals were considered strategically dangerous and
dealt with them as weapons.
All human rights for those people were suspended.
