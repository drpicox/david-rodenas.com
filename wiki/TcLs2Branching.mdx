title: Branching Strategy — TcLs2
---

This article covers how to create branchs in the [TcLs2] project.

When many people are collaborating on the same project, 
we need a way to cooperate and avoid conflicts. 
In repositories like Git, we need a strategy 
to work with everyone together.

In this assignment, we use a development based on the root branch (called master), 
but all changes are committed to other feature branches.

This is the overview of the branches:

```
  master
o------------------------[]----···
 \                       / PR
  \                     /
   \ feature/10_title  /
    ---o---o----o------
```

## New branch

You have to create a branch when you start to develop one issue. 
Create it always from the master. The branch name must follow this naming:
`feature/${issue_number}_${issue_title}`.

Work and frequently commit to that branch. 
Because each one of you is working on a single issue, 
there should be no new commits from other authors in that branch. 

Push the branch regularly to the GitHub repository. 
It would make a good backup of your work.

## PR: Pull Request

Once you have finished implementing your issue, 
make sure that you have committed everything, 
push your branch to GitHub. 

Enter into your project in GitHub, 
push the button to create a new Pull Request. 
The Pull Request is from your branch towards the master branch. 

Create the Pull Request and write the description. 
The description text must contain the following text: `Implements #${issue_numer}`. 
Example: "Implements #10". You also can add some details.

Review your commit, look to your changes. 
If you find anything that you want to improve or fix, 
do it, commit it, and push again. 
The Pull Request will reflect all changes.
When it looks good, mode your Issue card in the Board to Review.

Before the daily, 
review all of your Pull Requests and resolve all the comments that you might have.

## Conflicts!

Conflicts appear when someone else merges a code that changes the same parts that you have changed.

If your Pull Request conflicts with the master branch, 
you must solve it. 
GitHub will report that and will prevent the Pull Request to finish.

Go to your code, open the repository, 
fetch all new commits. Be sure that you bring the changes to the master branch.

Merge the branch master —with the changes— to your branch, 
solve the conflicts, and push it again to GitHub. 
If you did it ok, the conflict message of GitHub would disappear from the Pull Request.  

Notify it to your team members.
