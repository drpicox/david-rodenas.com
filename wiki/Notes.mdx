### Layouts components

```jsx
<Card>
  <Stack space="large">...</Stack>
  <Inline space="xsmall">...</Inline>
  <Columns space="xlarge">
    <Column>...</Column>
  </Columns>
</Card>
```

For a long time I was wondering which is the best strategy to define
reusable visual components. I found this presentation that I like a lot:

### Javascript default exports

```javascript
import aDefault form './module';

 // vs

import { aSymbol } form './module';
```

### Git Co-authors

To add co-authors to a commit, just add one or more “Co-authored-by” trailers to the end of the commit message:

```
Commit message

Co-authored-by: Joel Califa <602352+califa@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-authored-by: Matt Clark <44023+mclark@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Include your trailers at the end of your commit message, and have at least one line of white space before them.

### Mount Idiot or Dunning-Kruger effect

It happens when people believe that they know more than they know.
It is because they know so little that they do not know what they do not know.

### Tell! Don't Ask!

Tell-Don't-Ask is a principle that helps people remember that 
object-orientation is about bundling data with the functions 
that operate on that data.
It forbids query operations (ask) and enforces only invoke
actions (tell).

### Some Katas

This web-page contain some "katas", including the bowling kata.
They say kata, but they are more practices/exercises than katas.

### English writing

I am using Grammarly almost anywhere (except some times for markdowns
like this one), but there is something that bothers me:

Which one is correct?
a) The dog chases the cat.
b) The cat is chased by the dog.

Grammarly always answers _a)_, the rule says avoid the passive form.
But, it is not true, it [**depends**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM&feature=youtu.be&t=3974).

There a must see videos to learn this:

I wish I had them when I was doign my PhD.
