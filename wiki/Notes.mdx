### Layouts components

```jsx
<Card>
  <Stack space="large">...</Stack>
  <Inline space="xsmall">...</Inline>
  <Columns space="xlarge">
    <Column>...</Column>
  </Columns>
</Card>
```

For a long time I was wondering which is the best strategy to define
reusable visual components. I found this presentation that I like a lot:

### Javascript default exports

```javascript
import aDefault form './module';

 // vs

import { aSymbol } form './module';
```

### Git Co-authors

To add co-authors to a commit, just add one or more “Co-authored-by” trailers to the end of the commit message:

```
Commit message

Co-authored-by: Joel Califa <602352+califa@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-authored-by: Matt Clark <44023+mclark@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Include your trailers at the end of your commit message, and have at least one line of white space before them.

### Mount Idiot or Dunning-Kruger effect

It happens when people believe that they know more than they know.
It is because they know so little that they do not know what they do not know.

### Downs–Thomson paradox

Or why adding more lanes to a highway you only increment the commuting time.
It is a paradox in that improvements in the road network will not reduce traffic congestion. Improvements in the road network can make congestion worse if the improvements make public transport more inconvenient or if it shifts investment, causing disinvestment in the public transport system.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downs%E2%80%93Thomson_paradox

And before it came the Braess's paradox. It is the observation that adding one or more roads to a road network can slow down overall traffic flow through it. The paradox was postulated in 1968 by German mathematician Dietrich Braess, who noticed that adding a road to a particular congested road traffic network would increase overall journey time.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braess%27s_paradox

Braess's paradox has a counterpart in case of a reduction of the road network (which may cause a reduction of individual commuting time)

And related to `Induced Demand`

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induced_demand

City planner Jeff Speck has called induced demand "the great intellectual black hole in city planning, the one professional certainty that everyone thoughtful seems to acknowledge, yet almost no one is willing to act upon."

### Tell! Don't Ask!

Tell-Don't-Ask is a principle that helps people remember that 
object-orientation is about bundling data with the functions 
that operate on that data.
It forbids query operations (ask) and enforces only invoke
actions (tell).

### Some Katas

This web-page contain some "katas", including the bowling kata.
They say kata, but they are more practices/exercises than katas.

### English writing

I am using Grammarly almost anywhere (except some times for markdowns
like this one), but there is something that bothers me:

Which one is correct?
a) The dog chases the cat.
b) The cat is chased by the dog.

Grammarly always answers _a)_, the rule says avoid the passive form.
But, it is not true, it [**depends**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFwVf5a3pZM&feature=youtu.be&t=3974).

There a must see videos to learn this:

I wish I had them when I was doign my PhD.

### Motherfucking Website

Some time ago someone sent me the motherfucking website.
It was just a plain web without any style. But,
some time later, someone else, published the same web
but with just 7 more CSS rules. Amazing.
