### Layouts components

```jsx
<Card>
  <Stack space="large">...</Stack>
  <Inline space="xsmall">...</Inline>
  <Columns space="xlarge">
    <Column>...</Column>
  </Columns>
</Card>
```

For a long time I was wondering which is the best strategy to define
reusable visual components. I found this presentation that I like a lot:

### Javascript default exports

```javascript
import aDefault form './module';

 // vs

import { aSymbol } form './module';
```

### Git Co-authors

To add co-authors to a commit, just add one or more “Co-authored-by” trailers to the end of the commit message:

```
Commit message

Co-authored-by: Joel Califa <602352+califa@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-authored-by: Matt Clark <44023+mclark@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Include your trailers at the end of your commit message, and have at least one line of white space before them.
