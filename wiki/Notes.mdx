### Git Co-authors

To add co-authors to a commit, just add one or more “Co-authored-by” trailers to the end of the commit message:

```
Commit message

Co-authored-by: Joel Califa <602352+califa@users.noreply.github.com>
Co-authored-by: Matt Clark <44023+mclark@users.noreply.github.com>
```

Include your trailers at the end of your commit message, and have at least one line of white space before them.
