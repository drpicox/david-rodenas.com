title: Release Strategy â€” TcLs2
---

This article covers how to release the [TcLs2] project.
It assumes that you have already a Heroku account and a repository created. 

In this project, there is one release for each feature. Each time that there is a Pull Request, it implies a release. 

## Merging the Pull Request
Given an approved Pull Request, you can start its release.
The first step of the release is the merge of the Pull Request to the master branch. 

To merge the Pull Request, you have the following steps:
Download the branch to your development environment.
Merge, in your development environment, the master branch.
Run all tests and verify that they pass.
Run the application and test that everything works.
Merge the Pull Request: In GitHub, click the Merge button of the Pull Request. Make sure that it has the same commits that you have tested.

## Run Deploy
At this step, the master branch contains the changes in the Pull Request, but there is not release yet.

To deploy run the following steps:
Download the master branch into your environment,
Create a deploy branch, ex: deploy/version
Update version inside package.json
Execute the script ./deploy.sh

## Integrating deploy changes into master
At this step, the master branch is released. However, deploy changes are not yet integrated into the master branch. 

Create a Pull Request from the deploy branch to the master branch. 
Share this Pull Request with the other team members so they can approve it, and it can be merged back to master.

They must approve it if the release is done, and the package.json version is updated.
