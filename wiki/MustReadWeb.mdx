These sites are remarkable. 
I do not know how I lived without reading them before. 
I am sure that there are more like them, 
just undiscovered for me in the vast sea of the Internet.

Co-founder of StackOverflow, Trello and more,
he has a great vision of how developers become productive.

developers.

Robert C. Martin, aka Uncle Bob, from my perspective, 
is one of the greatest advocates of the developer profession. 
He has a unique vision for our profession 
that enacts a high degree of responsibility and results. 
Martin is one of the main contributors to the Agile movement, 
a great communicator. He has a lot of valuable contents; 
check for SOLID or for the Bowling Kata.

Douglas Crockford, for me in short, 
is the guy who understood Javascript. 
He has a head manager in Yahoo, 
responsible for developers for many years and 
author of the famous book "Javascript the Good Parts". 
If you work with Javascript, 
you should read and see 
the guy who understood Javascript.
