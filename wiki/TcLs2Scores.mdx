Remember that the big red alert sign <span style={{color: 'red'}}>⚠️</span>
means that the real score is 3 or below.
It is mandatory to have no red box in any section. 

Fix this situation looking for the red boxes in your row. 
Once you have no red boxes, then you are eligible to pass the course. 
Remove them by delivering missing work. Given a column, you can remove a red (by repeating the step) by:
- **Issues**: add one or more stories well written. Explain what is about, and show examples about how the player will use the game. Note that you do not need to implement them.
- **Develops**: implement any other available story and create the pull request.
- **Reviews**: review any pull request, reject them if they are not complete (ex: it does not have front/back tests), or approve them.
- **Cov**: implement and successfully merge a new issue with a high degree of coverage.
- **Front**: implement and successfully merge a new issue that contains front-end development. Try also having a rich test.
- **Back**: implement and successfully merge a new issue that contains back-end development. Try also having a rich test.

Note that you can realize these same steps to improve your score and ensure better success in passing the course in case something happens in the exam.
