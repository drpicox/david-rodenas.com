title: Testing

Testing is amazing.
I cannot figure out how I was able to sleep comfortably before Testing.
I was great coding, I loved to do [DefensiveCoding], 
I was proud of my work, but once I understood Testing, 
I realized that I was not a fraction as good as I am today.

I was a great detractor of Testing. 
I was reading a lot of Testing, I thought that 
I learned a lot about it, but almost everything was 
contradictory or did not make sense. 
But one day I realized that it was not my fault, 
neither fault of Testing: almost every 
How to Test on the internet at that time was awful. 
Luckily it has changed.

If you have to start Testing today I have some advice:

- **Learning to test properly is as complicated as programming**. 
  It is a new skill that you have to learn. 
  But it is worthy; once you mastered Testing, 
  you will be faster (and safer) with tests that without them.

- **Testing is your best documentation**. 
  Tests should be easy to understand and ready to copy-paste. 
  They have to explain which functionalities your code has, and how to use them. 

- **Write about functionalities, not functions**. 
  Do not let the word Unit deceive you: you are not testing methods, 
  classes, or modules. You are testing functionalities. 
  Write a test for each possible case, and later, 
  in its section, exceptional cases, exception, and regression tests.

- **Never test _private_ representations**. 
  Never. You are testing how to use it; if you use internal structures, 
  you will not be able to refactor.

- **Refactor and refactor your test until it is easy to understand**. 
  Do it in green and as many times as you need. 
  Do not be afraid of creating auxiliary code, structures, 
  and artifacts to simplify your Testing. Readability and maintainability are key.

- **Get rid of mocks**. 
  The only mocks that you need are for the real user. 
  Mocks destroy the confidence in tests and make future refactors harder. 
  As Kent C. Dodds express
