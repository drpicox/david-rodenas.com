        get: getProp,
        enumerable: true
      });

Although this PR was not accepted as it,
@gkalpak (part of AngularJS core ) 
used it as base for [full ngClass refactor](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/commit/1d3b65adc2c22ff662159ef910089cf10d1edb7b).
As he explains:

>  In large based on #14404. Kudos to @drpicox for the initial idea and a big part
>  of the implementation.

The reason behind of being implemented by him was to refactor everything
quickly with multiple commits avoiding the PR proposal/accept delays.

```
blabla
```

```javascript
a = 3
```


Before this PR there was some tricks that have to be done in the 
ngClass expressions to make sure that they are fast enough:

```javascript
    <i class="icon" ng-class="{friendly: !!user.friends, male: user.isMale}">...</i>
    <td ng-class="todo.completed && 'completed'">...</td>
```

After this PR, the performances is good not matters the syntax:

```javascript
    <i class="icon" ng-class="{friendly: user.friends, male: user.isMale}">...</i>
    <td ng-class="{completed: todo.completed}">...</td>
```

I have also created a [PR with benchpress](../angularjs-ngclass-benchpress)
to make sure that performance improvements are good.
