---
Mock timers is hard, because you cannot wait the test to finish.

Here there are links to an implementation of a Timer and its mock:

- Implementation: https://github.com/TC-LS2/adventure-game/blob/master/src/main/java/com/drpicox/game/utils/TimerTaskRunner.java
- Use it: https://github.com/TC-LS2/adventure-game/blob/master/src/main/java/com/drpicox/game/rooms/RoomController.java#L65

- Mock: https://github.com/TC-LS2/adventure-game/blob/master/src/test/java/com/drpicox/game/mocks/TimerTaskRunnerMock.java
- Mock Configuration: https://github.com/TC-LS2/adventure-game/blob/master/src/test/java/com/drpicox/game/mocks/TimerTaskRunnerMock.java
- Test it: https://github.com/TC-LS2/adventure-game/blob/master/src/test/java/com/drpicox/game/RoomRefreshTests.java
