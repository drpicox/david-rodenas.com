How to add new tests?

<Deck>


<Slide>


## Creating the test

The first step is the test creation. You need to:

1. Create a `post.md`
2. Create and pass the backend test
3. Create and pass the frontend test

</Slide><Slide>


## Create and pass backend test

</Slide><Slide>


### Create a new post.md file

Copy the markdown contents from the issue to the following file:

```
/src/main/resources/blog/yyyy-mm-dd_title_with_undercases.md
```

- `yyyy`: is the current year
- `mm`: is the current month with two digits (01 january, 10 october)
- `dd`: is the current day with two digits (04, 10, 17 or 31)
- `title_with_undercases`: is the title replacing no letter/numbers by a single underscore

</Slide><Slide>


### Create the JUnit test file

Create the corresponding class in the test package:

```
/src/test/com.drpicox.game/Post_yyyymmdd_TitleInUpperPascalCase_Test.java
```

- `yyyy`: is the current year
- `mm`: is the current month with two digits (01 january, 10 october)
- `dd`: is the current day with two digits (04, 10, 17 or 31)
- `TitleInUpperPascalCase`: is the title replacing no letter/numbers by a single underscore

The file content should be:

```java
package com.drpicox.game;

import ...

@ActiveProfiles("test")
@ExtendWith(SpringExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest
@AutoConfigureMockMvc
public class Post_yyyymmdd_TitleInUpperPascalCase_Test {

    @Autowired private PostTestFactory postTestFactory;

    @TestFactory
    List<DynamicTest> makeTests() throws Exception {
        return postTestFactory.createTests("yyyy-mm-dd_title_with_undercases");
    }
}
```

> > ⚠️ **Important**: Do not forget to add `_Test` at the end of the classname.
> > It is necessary to run the tests automatically from the command line.
> > Also make sure that the name matches the blog, because there is an
> > automatic process that evaluates that all posts have test.

</Slide><Slide>


### Running steps

Each blog sentence is a test step. The `PostRunner` recognizes
each one and executes the appropiate test step. For example:

```
[PLSLiterature              ] ## Let's begin the game
[PLSEmptyLine               ]
[PLSLiterature              ] ### Create a gameplay
[PLSEmptyLine               ]
[PLSLiterature              ] Before playing, register you and your friend to play.
[PLSEmptyLine               ]
[ClickNewGameInTheMainHeader] > Click _New Game_ in the main header.
[TypeIntoTheNewGameName     ] > Type _FirstGame_ into the _new game name_.
[SelectIntoTheGameScenario  ] > Select _Basic_ into the _game scenario_.
```

</Slide><Slide>


### Steps structure

```java
package com.drpicox.game.testSteps.newGame;

import ...

@Component
public class TypeIntoTheNewGameName extends AbstractPostLineStep {

    private final TestPostForms testPostForms;

    public TypeIntoTheNewGameName(TestPostForms testPostForms) {
                               // ^- Spring injects here the TestPostForms
        this.testPostForms = testPostForms;
        // ^- and the class saves it for later
    }

    @Override
    protected String getRegex() {
        return "Type _([^_]+)_ into the _new game name_";
             // ^- this is a regular expresion
             //       ^- this is the capture group [1]
    }

    @Override
    protected void run(PostLine line, String[] match) {
        String name = match[1]; // <- gets the capture group [1]
        var newGame = testPostForms.getForm(NewGameForm.class);
                      // ^- gets the current form values for NewGameForm.class
        newGame.changeGameName(name);
    }
}
```

</Slide><Slide>


### Steps packages

Steps are orgenized in packages to ease finding them.
Current packages are:

```
testSteps
  - board      # checks for cards in the hand or in a table
  - cheating   # help to advance the state quickly and set mocks
  - enterGame  # handles a player entering to a game
  - newGame    # handles the game creation
  - play       # player actions of playing cards into piles
  - players    # ready/refresh and tools to quickly change player
```

</Slide><Slide>


### Missing steps

Some times you write sentences that have no step associated:

```
2020-08-24_defensing_fields:12  > Click _New Game_ in the main header.
2020-08-24_defensing_fields:13  > Type _FirstGame_ into the _new game name_.


java.lang.AssertionError: There are no PostLineSteps (0) matching the instruction:
=> 2020-08-24_defensing_fields:13  > Type _FirstGame_ into the _new game name_.

	at com.drpicox.game.testPost.PostRunner.newErrorNoRunnersFound(PostRunner.java:72)
	at com.drpicox.game.testPost.PostRunner.runLine(PostRunner.java:35)
```

If that happens:

- Check if you have misspelled
- Check if you have another sentence that does the same
- Check if there is a better sentence
- Add a new Step if it is necessary

</Slide><Slide>


### Add new steps

The convention for adding one new step is creating a class that has
as name the upper pascal case of the text of the sentence, but removing
the variables.

- Start copy/pasting a similar step
- Add the sentence to the appropiate package
- Make sure that you use the naming convention
- They inherit from `AbstractPostLineStep`
- Make sure that they have the `@Component` annotation

> > Some old classes have substituted variables in his name by X, Y, ...
> > remove them. For example:
> > rename `TypeXIntoTheNewGameName` into `TypeIntoTheNewGameName`.

</Slide><Slide>


### Forms

Backend has no view and no player state. Forms emulate that state.

```java
class TestPostForms {
  <T> T newForm(Class<T> formClass) // creates (and replaces) a form from a class
  <T> T getForm(Class<T> formClass) // gets the form of that class
  <T> T setForm(T formInstance)     // sets a form instance for a given class
}
```

- Steps creates new forms when the user enters to a view, ex: `ClickNewGameInTheMainHeader`
- Steps sets values to the form, ex: `TypeIntoTheNewGameName`
- Steps reads from forms to make assertions, ex: `TheCurrentPlayerIs`
- Steps replaces form content with API responses: `ClickTheEnterButton`

</Slide><Slide>


### SnapshotService

Use the SnapshotService to emulate API calls from the backend.

```java
@Component
public class ClickTheEnterButton extends AbstractPostLineStep {

    private final TestPostForms testPostForms;
    private final SnapshotService snapshotService;

    public ClickTheEnterButton(TestPostForms testPostForms, SnapshotService snapshotService) {
        this.testPostForms = testPostForms;
        this.snapshotService = snapshotService;
    }

    @Override
    protected String getRegex() { return "Click the _Enter_ button";  }

    @Override
    protected void run(PostLine line, String[] match) {
        var form = testPostForms.getForm(EnterGameForm.class);
        var game = form.getGameName();
        var player = form.getPlayerName();
        var result = snapshotService.get("/api/v1/games/"+game+"/players/"+player, null, VisibleGameForm.class);
        testPostForms.setForm(result);
    }
}
```

</Slide><Slide>


### Snapshot step

After a step needs to use the SnapshotService,
you need an extra hidden sentence in the markdown to save
the snapshot.

```
 > Click the _Create Game_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT status=200 -->
```

It invokes the `PLSSnapshot`, which saves the last API call into
the corresponding _snapshots.json_. It also checks that the service
returns the expected status.

Make sure that you always add a step for saving the snapshot after
any step that emulates an API call.

</Slide><Slide>


### Multiple step errors

Each sentence can only be matched by one and only by one step.
If given one sentence, it can match two steps, it fails:

```
2020-08-21_buying_fields:31  > _Martel_ has in his hand _2_ _event_ card of _sheep_.


java.lang.AssertionError: Too many PostLineSteps (2) matches the instruction:
=> 2020-08-21_buying_fields:31  > _Martel_ has in his hand _2_ _event_ card of _sheep_.
They are:
  - Matches "_([^_]+)_ has in h[ei][rs] hand _([^_]+)_ _([^_]+)_ card" (com.drpicox.game.testSteps.board.HasInHisHandNCards)
  - Matches "_([^_]+)_ has in h[ei][rs] hand _([^_]+)_ _([^_]+)_ cards? of _([^_]+)_" (com.drpicox.game.testSteps.board.HasInHisHandNCardsOf)


	at com.drpicox.game.testPost.PostRunner.newErrorTooManyMatches(PostRunner.java:68)
	at com.drpicox.game.testPost.PostRunner.runLine(PostRunner.java:33)
```

Note that the first match is a shorter version of the same sentence and because of it fails,
one is a subset of the other.
Be caurefule when redacting new sentences, or use regex exclusion patterns
to avoid those cases.

</Slide><Slide>


## Frontend

Frontend and backend run the same set of sentences,
but they have different implementations.

- You have to replicate steps in frontend
- You have to use the UI from your steps
- Forms are the ones in the UI
- API calls are executed by the UI interaction
- PLSSnapshot checks that the UI did the correct API call and provides the response

</Slide><Slide>


### Frontend folders

Javascript does not have packages, but it has folders, they are:

```
src/www/__test__/testSteps
  - board/      # checks for cards in the hand or in a table
  - cheating/   # ignores mocks and cheating at backend
  - enterGame/  # handles a player entering to a game
  - forms/      # generic sentences to handle forms (!!!)
  - newGame/    # handles the game creation
  - play/       # player actions of playing cards into piles
  - players/    # ready/refresh and tools to quickly change player
```

</Slide><Slide>


### @testing-library helpers

There are some testing accessors that are common for more than
one step, they are inside `helpers` folder inside boards, ex:

```
src/www/__test__/testSteps/board/
  - helpers/
    - getAllByCard.ts        # see example
    - getAllByCardOf.ts
    - ...
    - index.js               # barrel
  - configureInjector.ts     # steps registration
  - HasAtTheSquareACardOf.ts # step implementation
  - ...
```

```typescript
import { getAllByTestId } from "@testing-library/dom"

export function getAllByCard(
  container: HTMLElement,
  type: string
): HTMLElement[] {
  return getAllByTestId(container, `card-${type}`)
}
```

</Slide><Slide>


### Create a step

```typescript
import { AbstractPostLineStep } from "../AbstractPostLineStep"
import { getAllByCard, getByHand } from "../board/helpers"
// it uses helpers from other folders ---^ (becareful with dependency cycle)
import { playCardIntoPile } from "./helpers"
// it uses helpers from its folder -^

export class PlaysACardIntoHisSquarePile extends AbstractPostLineStep {
  constructor() {
    super(
      /_([^_]+)_ plays an? _([^_]+)_ card into h[ei][rs] square _([^_]+)_ pile/i
      // ^- the regular expression that matches
      // ^- capture group [1]                                   ^- & [3]
      //                     ^- capture group [2]
    )
  }

  async runMatch(_: any, match: string[]) {
    const [, player, type, square] = match
    // ^- destructuring to get capture group values
    const hand = getByHand(document.body, player)
    const [card] = getAllByCard(hand, type)
    // ^- finds things in the UI to operate

    playCardIntoPile(card, `${player}-square-${square}`)
    // ^- and operates (here with a helper)
  }
}
```

</Slide><Slide>


### Register the step

```typescript
import { Injector } from "www/injector"
import { PostLineStep } from "www/__test__/testPost"
import { ClickEnterGameInTheMainHeader } from "./ClickEnterGameInTheMainHeader"

export default function configureEnterGameInjector(injector: Injector) {
  injector.register(PostLineStep, ClickEnterGameInTheMainHeader)
  //                ^- it is a PostLineStep
  //          it is the class implementation -^
}
```

</Slide><Slide>


### Asyncronous

Javascript executes API call asynchronously, and it requires special code
to wait for its completaion.

The frontend has a loader spinner that test utilized to wait data loading.
See `PLSSnapshot`:

```typescript
export class PLSSnapshot implements PostLineStep {
  ...

  async run(line: PostLine) {
    ...

    expect(screen.getByTestId("loading")).toBeInTheDocument();
    // ^- makes sure that the AfterStep hints loading
    interaction.resolve(snapshot.responseStatus, snapshot.responseBody);
    await waitForElementToBeRemoved(() => screen.getByTestId("loading"));
    // ^- waits that the API call has finished and results rendered
  }
}
```

</Slide><Slide>


## Quirks

</Slide><Slide>


### Cheats and mocks

There are special sentences to advance quickly the game, or ensure
that random cards are the ones that we expect in the tests, they are:

```
[CheatDiscardsNCardsOfAtSquare] CHEAT _Martel_ discards _3_ _event_ cards of _fire_ at square _1_
[CheatPicksNCardsAtSquare     ] CHEAT _Martel_ picks _3_ _food_ cards at square _1_
[CheatPicksNCardsOfAtSquare   ] CHEAT _Martel_ picks _3_ _field_ cards _seaport_ at square _1_
[MockTakeAs                   ] MOCK take _field_ as _frest_
```

</Slide><Slide>


### Multiuser quirks

Test only evaluates one frontend instance each time,
but we need to emulate multiple browsers.

One way is to enter each time with the corresponding user,
but it is boring for the user and difficults the readability
of the test.

Instead of it there are special Steps that deal with that.
For example:

- `AllPlayersClickReadyAndThenRefreshInTheMainHeader`:
  emulates that all players click ready and refresh
- `UseTheBrowserOf`:
  emulates that there are multiple users
