title: Release Strategy

This article covers how to release the [ProjectsWith] project. It assumes that
you have already a Heroku account and a repository created.

## When to Release

The Release Manager has to make a release for each pull request approved by its
reviewers.

## Tools

Deploy tools are built on top of [BASH](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/).

- If you are using UNIX (Linux or Mac) probably you are already using BASH.
- If you are using Windows, you probably have Git BASH installed.

## Release process

### 1. Test branch on your local

1. Fetch changes from the GitHub repository
2. Checkout the branch into your local
3. Merge master into your local branch
4. Run the tests:

```bash
> ./mvnw test
> yarn test
```

### If 1. Fails

- Return to your working branch.
- Delete your feature master branch.
- Notify through the PR the problem.

### 2. Merge branch into GirHub master

If all tests passes locally, go to GitHub, look for the PullResquest and click
Merge to master.

> > Make sure that it says merge to master.

### 3. Deploy the project on Heroku

1. Fetch changes from the GitHub repository
2. Change to the master branch
3. Pull changes from master
4. Run the deplou script:

```bash
> ./deploy.sh
```

### 4. Cleanup

Return to your working branch and:

1. Delete the old already deployed feature branch
2. Delete your local master branch

## Some final notes

Make sure that all tests passes from command line. If they doesn't, the bot will
assume that you have failed in your task.
