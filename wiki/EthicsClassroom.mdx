title: "Ethics Classroom"
---

In 2020, during the COVID confinement, I was teaching Software Engineering 3 at
the University. I like the last day of class to be always different to make
students aware of their work's repercussions. In that case and those
circumstances, I built a special presentation with all the contents and
comments. You can find the slides here:

It starts with real cases and how ICT professionals impact the lives of other
people. And then it continues empowering them, with rules and rights that they
observe follow.
