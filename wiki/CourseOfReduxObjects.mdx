In Javascript objects are maps with string keys and mixed values, plus suger
syntax to access them like arrays or with dot notation.

```javascript
const object = {
  keyA: valueA,
  keyB: valueB,
  /* … */
};
```

## Objects

![Redux Objects](/images/redux/redux-objects.png)

Use objects as the rows of a database of each duck.

### Traverse all keys

Use the for to traverse all keys of the object:

```javascript
for (let key in object) {
  const currentElement = array[key];
  /* … */
}
```

### Copy

Duplicate an array with the triple dot notation:

```javascript
const copy = { ...original };
```

### Delete an element

Use delete keyword to remove a _column_:

```javascript
delete copy[key];
```

### Insert one element

Use the assignation to add a _column_:

```javascript
copy[key] = element;
```

### Replacing an element

Use the assignation to replace an element

```javascript
copy[key] = element;
```

### Important

> > **Important**: Remember always to make a copy.

Some times it is easy to forget to make a copy, specially when there are objects
inside of objects.

For example, given the following object:

```javascript
const object = {
  name: "Dr. Thermo",
  power: {
    name: "Climate Change",
    strength: 5,
  },
};
```

If we want to change the strength we cannot do the following:

```javascript
const copy = { ...object };
// WRONG: do not do that (look: two points)
copy.power.strength = newStrength;
```

Instead, we have to copy both, the object and the power:

```javascript
const copy = { ...object };
const powerCopy = { ...object.power };

// OK (look: only one point)
powerCopy.strength = newStrength;
copy.power = powerCopy;
```
