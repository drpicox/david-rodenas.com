Hi! I am David Rodenas, PhD on high performance computing, 
computer engineer, and a big lover of this new technology.

This page is shiny new and has almost nothing.
Right now I just have copied some old content here:

- [AngularJsComponentsEs2015]
- [AngularJsComponentsTypescript]
- [AngularJsDesigners]
- [AngularJsNgClassPerformance]
- [AngularJsNgClassPerformanceLargeObjects]
- [AngularJsShoppingCartDemo]
- [NpmOffline]
- [RaftImplementation]

And not so old content:

- [Notes]
